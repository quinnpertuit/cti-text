WSICBWVTBU,This is the worse thing ive ever purchased. I cant even get one stick of wood in this piece of crap. It looked much bigger in the picture
H4ASVFLBAY,Great little camp stove.  It keeps our camp in Northern Maine toasty warm.  It’s a perfect fit.  It burns very efficiently.
EFN0ECHFTH,"Too small for the money,"
8TAYQUS3LL,Delivery dropped the package and broke the stove.  Had to chose a different stove.
7OOG2BYUMF,"I have a 1960's version of this stove design, all the parts are even interchangeable, same casting design. There problems people have are when the damper and flu aren't balanced. Mine burns well, no smoke inside once set right. I can load it up and it'll heat most of the night without attention. There's a reason this stove design has been around a very long time, it's proven, and works great."
DCLCJAZRLM,"Love the wood stove, unfortunately none of the parts come with it, pipe, pipe connections, pipe Jack's, brick, furnace cement etc and none of the Home Depot employees had any idea on these items so I am still trying to get the right parts ordered after getting wrong sizes."
9UBPZKMBY1,"The stove arrived very well packaged! It was simple to assemble and looks really nice! 
The first fire kept going out due to poor airflow, but that may be caused by the chimney not being warm yet. I will need to have more fires to determine the cause. It looks beautiful in place of the old rusted boxwood stove. Very happy, providing I can solve the issue causing it to stop burning."

C7GC1BBJUB,Received earlier than expected so that was great !
SPLX8RQQVX,Extremely easy to install. I've already recommended it to a lot of friends. Great for outside brush piles.
NEAU6PKLUN,"Not only does it fit a barrel, but I’ve put my kit on to an oil tank that I cut out and had a friend weld. The only draw back is the damper doesn’t let in enough air to get a big fire going needed to get a big boil on the sap. Another thing I’ve noticed is the door is showing some rust, possibly due to the heat from the wood fire.  However, it works well and looks awesome. I would purchase this product again."

Z8BTXE8OHH,"First of all, this is made in China. And its not very good cast iron. Tots of voids and such - clearly the result of poor sand and worn patterns. 

It arrived quickly, but one of the legs that goes between the barrels was broken. Called US stove (per included directions) and was assured a replacement would be sent out immediately. Received it almost 14 days later. And it was the wrong part. Not that it mattered anyway: the between barrel leg kit is too big to match the coupler that is shipped with the kit.

Speaking of too big, the legs really don't fit the curvature of a 55 gallon drum.

Additionally, its pretty obvious that the legs were originally designed to have two bars holding them together, not just a tiny 1/4 inch machine screw and nut. A fender washer is a must for safety. And, be prepared to use a grinder on the legs to get a good finish - lots of flash and such left in place.

Lastly, carefully reading the manufacturers instructions, the stove is not recommended or intended for actual use. Just temporary outdoor use only. Not intended for heating. I guess its for looks only.

Its pretty darn clear to me that this was seriously re-engineered to be a cheap knockoff product of what was originally back in the day an excellent product that was a testament to backyard engineering and DIY craftsmanship.

As you can see from the picture, I did some serious mods to make this effective."

ZISLMWMKU0,"Winter is fast approaching. This is a four year testament review to a barrel kit heater. I purchased everything I needed to put a barrel heater in my shop four years ago and could not be any happier. On the coldest days this system will run you out of my shop. As one can see, I sat the heater on blocks for better air flow, used black stove pipe, and a heater barrel sold here at The Home Depot. I learned that the key to a long lasting system is to apply high heat paint on my stove components and change the pipe and barrel out if pin holes appear. I highly recommend adding 5- 6 inches of dirt (yes dirt) or sand-spread out evenly to the bottom and getting a grate for the wood to sit on. This keeps the heater bottom from burning out prematurely. An old trick used by many wood heating people. The heat is regulated by the damper and the air flow door on the kit. I do not recommend this type of system for indoor applications. The Home Depot sells many quality stoves and triple wall pipe systems for safe in- home use. I highly recommend this simple kit and type of heater solution for those on a budget. Now is the time to get ready for the colder days ahead!"

EUPM9GQF2E,Wiseway pellet stove eliminates the need for electricity by utilizing a natural gravity feed system that eliminates all of the typical electrical and mechanical parts found in traditional pellet heaters plus it's Quiet. Caution This stove must have a good draft or it will not work properly. You must have a proper chimney system.
TAJM6L1HCD,"Minor quality issues with unit. Gaskets don't seal, gaps in pellet feed/stove box leaking smoke, mounting base bolt had thread damage.Some tinkering needed to help feed and burn effectively. If you like tinkering with ROCKET STOVES, you'll love this challenge. Requires some monitoring periodically to keep working well. Radiant heat would improve with air flow across unit. For now, will weld a shelf to side to set a peltier fan to improve distribution. If centrally located inside a home or cabin, this might work better. Cleaning unit between uses takes more time than conventional pellet stove. Creosote build up seems more prevalent than with other pellet stoves. Keep it above 400° and works better.
Use two other pellet and three wood burning stoves before this one. This unit has fun potential!"
59BRUS9WEY,"It's a bear to lite but once its lit, nice quiet warm.  Smoke pours out of it around burn pot while starting. Once it hints temp it's fine the trick it to get it hot fast. Still the freedom to have heat without electricity worth all the minor flaws."
AQEGIHDPBN,"I live in Pennsylvania, I have used this for about 1 month now, bought it new from the company that installed my new flu liner (5"" 304 stainless) They said I had a great draft and it should run nicely. The stove was light enough for me too move into possission myself and hook up to the flu. Filling the hopper was a difficult for me because my distance from the back wall is only 6"" and the hopper is not very wide, so you have to either scoop them in with a large cup or hold the bag up and slowly pour them in, while a bunch spill onto the floor. I was very excited when I first lit the stove and the temperature rose to 700 in about 20 minutes. I ran it all night (about 9 hours) on high while sleeping, When I checked it the next morning the temperature was at 300 and the room was not very warm, I Found that the ashes did not fall through the secondary burn chamber into the ash pan as it should have, when i pulled the secondary burn chamber out, large clumps of ash fell into the ash pan. The next two days that I used this the temperature would not rise as high as the day before, so after the third day I decided to clean it. Apon opening the glass door on the front I noticed a large amount of ashes were piled up in the first bend and the tube where the adjustable draft is. I believe this cut down on my draft. I couldnt get to the next two bends due to no access, so I took an air hose and blew them down the tubes(very messy) lots of ashes, im sure it was enough to stop my draft even more. I then repeated the same process for another three days with a different brand of pellets, same results. I added three ecofans to the stove, but it still isnt enough to help much. The only way I can keep this stove warm enough to heat my small basement to 70 degrees is to run it on high at all times, leave the burn chamber door off for more air flow, knock the ashes from the secondary burn chamber down about every 4 hours, and clean it every day. This means I am cleaning it and using 2 bags of pellets every day. If you have electricity, I would not buy this stove. I feel The only people this would satisfy are those with very small cabins that have no electricty. I have $1650 in the stove with taxes, and am very dissapointed. I would Send this stove back, but the restocking fee that i found on the internet is outragous."
QGYPOF0ZS2,"Hello,

My name is Michelle and I purchased a WiseWay last year just before summer. It has not even been a full winter and my basket has fallen apart. Two of the bars are no long exiting and the one bar on the side is gone. Is this normal? I am using the slow burn basket now that also came with my Wiseway and my house is to cold. 
I love my stove but not the fact my basket has fallen apart after just a few months."
YYVOHZLGDM,"Purchased this stove to replace a wood stove to make life a little easier, cutting 5 cords of fire wood has become challenging at our age. Received the stove from Home Depot in February of this year Order, Delivery to the Store and Pickup was easy and quick. Installed the stove used our 6"" existing wood stove pipe, connected a 6"" to 3"" reducer to the top of the stove. Connected a fresh air supply line to the back of the stove. The Wiseway works like a wood stove, it works off of draft so very important to have a fresh air pipe installed. The Wiseway puts out a lot of heat we have no problems heating a 1400 sq ft house. These stoves are designed to use 100 percent Doug Fir Pellet which I have available to me here in Oregon. This stove is very easy to operate. Cleaning is a lot easier then a wood stove clean up, about every 4 to 5 days open the burn chamber and run a ash vacuum up thru the tube to remove any ash that has built up. It you install this stove correctly you should have no problems with it operating properly, I have read feed back from other people who failed to install their stove correctly and have had problem operating it. I would recommend this Wiseway to anyone who wants to make there life a little easier. Reading the Instructions is Very Important Understanding how to adjust the burn basket for your heat range. Very simple to do. I Highly recommend this stove very easy to operate."

SWIBAZVGPO,"I am very pleased with my stove. It works exactly as expected. One thing very important, you must have an exhaust vent that either goes straight up through the roof, or through the wall with no more than 2 elbows. Air flow is very important! I filled my house with smoke because I had 3 elbows in the vent pipe. The stove is well built and solid. Looks like a WORK of MODERN ART in my living room.Writing this review in my warm house, next to my Wiseway Stove."
XAADUKDYML,The US Stove Wiseway Gravity Fed Pellet Stove is an asset to my heating system in my home. It allows me to cut down the thermostat saving on my energy bills while providing an additional kind of warmth that is beyond compare.
DQOS7GXRGE,"Does not put out 40,000 BTU! The manual that comes with the stove states that an independent “official” test rated the stove between 7000 BTU and 20,000 BTU. I have a straight 12 foot flue, outside air hookup and have adjusted the burn box,  even 20,000 BTU is doubtful. Stove is a gimmick. Avoid it!"

UEB5UM5KB5,I baught my stove last year.. I found out puting a non draft chimney top on was very important! Adding a damper is important too. These stoves kick off really great heat. I heat my whole house! No breakable parts! Love this! If installed properly.. No smoke comes in house. I am a girl and installed it by myself. Also not.. Make shure out side pipe is at leadt 10 feet above roof line! I am getting another one for my cabin! If your old like me.. I use a small soup pan to fill the back so i dont have to lift the heavy pellet bags! Home you enjoy yours as much as i do! Thank you to the man that invented this stove. I have finally found a great pellet stove! I live in north east Iowa. Trust me we get some cold weather cause the Canadian swath goes through here!
EYAGSU2FZH,"Before we bring this stove into the house, we have tried it several times outside between rain storms. We have had the following problems. Can someone from US Stove help me address these issues?
1. The stove smokes very badly in the beginning to the point where there is no way we can have this stove in our house. We have been trying it out outside with no stove pipe attached. I am following instructions to use a propane torch and to wait for the temperature to reach 200F to get the draft going before opening up the pellets and letting them drop.
2. The maximum temp that the stove reaches is 550F. The videos I watched and literature I read before purchasing the unit stated that it gets to 700F. I was expecting 700F so that it will heat my 2000 sq ft house. Is 550F enough for 2000 sq ft. 
3. On a calm day, no appreciable wind, after reaching max temp and letting it stay at that temp for 1 hour, if I open the damper slider to bring the temp down which I know with this stove is the opposite of what normally happens when a damper is opened, smoke starts to come out of the small pellet chamber just above the burn basket area. Closing the damper slider stops the smoke. In the installation guide, it is stated: ""Apply adhesive side of insulation rope to the top edge of the hopper opening, and then fold the rope over the hopper opening edges."" This is not how any of the gaskets were pre-installed on the unit by the manufacturer, and the gaskets that were pre-installed are much smaller diameter than the gaskets pictured in the install guide. Is this why the stove is smoking and can the proper gaskets be provided if so.
4. In the videos I watched before making this purchase, the stove had wheels. This one does not. This one has a flat rectangular plate at the bottom. Even the owner's operation and installation manual for this model # shows a unit that has bars on the bottom where wheels attach. 
I really wanted this stove to work for us. 
Very disappointed so far. Please advise."
O4YOHOOPRT,"this is probably the most unreliable stove I have ever owned, mine will never burn longer then one bag of pellets befor you have to clean it, the burnner cage collects clinkers an d it stops burning and smokes the whole house up all the smoke detectors go off, very unreliable to go away and leave it unattended, I have had this stove less then one month, tried different brands of pellets all act the same.
I cartainly would not reccomend this stove to anybody.a gross waste of money."

LQIYCYR575,"I purchased this stove as a backup heat source for when the power goes out in the winter due to ice storms. I would give this stove a 5/5 stars, except there is an issue with pellet feed. This stove is gravity fed, and uses no electricity to feed the pellets into the burn chamber. Due to the design of the pellet hopper, occasionally the pellets do not move to the pellet chute. If you check on it periodically, or keep the hopper full, you have no issues. It's when you let the hopper run low that the stove can go out."
YWJQMMTMAX,"Great stove, Good for off grid use"
FRERNNKXQZ,very very nice pellet stove works well
A7QY0NCPJI,"I haven’t had the stove very long, but Inhave been using it with different brands of pellets and adjusting the basket width. I have only had access to hardwood pellets. So far it’s working fairly good, except the basket seems to ash up after a while, even if the ash tray is not full. The fire then dies out. I have spread the grate basket, but have not been able to figure out how to solve this issue. I would recommend the heater, but some other people have complained about it. If you purchase this stove, it is important to experiment with different pellets and the grate openings."
XKKR4N47Q8,Stove came in damaged crate. Stove parts are bent. Stove parts are missing.
KP04BPMUBP,"My husband put this stove together in about 15 minutes and once he got the pipe kit put together we were burning with pellets in no time. Steady, even heat that is very comfortable. Love!"
IVULCCW4WO,"The pellet stove has a unique, attractive design and looks nice in a home setting.  It is a conversation piece to say the least.  As for installing, it was quite easy.  Heating our 2,000+ sq. ft. house is not a problem for this stove.  We clean it out twice a day which is simple to do.  Finding the pellets that we like the best seems to be our challenge.  I would not want to revert back to conventional heating.  This stove meets our expectations and needs."
XQBTNXUWDX,The Wiseway stove is preforming beyond my expectations. It starts easy and quickly.
VRMN3CE9IW,It showed up alright but i am having issues about the exhaust system its a 3 and a half stove pipe and nobody carrys the pipes for it and the ones who do are charging outrageous prices for the pipe

JNUPPKFPOX,"just got the stove setup followed instructions for startup, reach 600 degrees in 35mins. going to see how long 40lbs will burn. raised temperature in the room 20 degrees in less than an hour from starting the torch. 2000 sq. ft."
YUPBKDLX62,"I often lose power during ice storms so when I learned that pellet stoves with forced exhaust are dangerous to run when the power is out, I started looking for an alternative. I read every thing I could about this stove. It came with some issues: the exhaust is 3"" but 3"" pipe did not fit - I had to do some creative crimping to make it work; ash buildup chokes out the flame unless you find a way to knock it out of the primary burn basket - easy enough to handle I use a long metal file every few hours. Those are the drawbacks.

The benefits are fantastic. The stove gives a warm even heat with little upkeep, especially compared to the hassle of a wood stove. I have had a few questions and the help is very friendly, helpful and responsive. I can let the stove run all night and it keeps the house warm.

Summary, this stove is a machine you have to learn. There is an art to getting and keeping it working, but it is far easier than a wood stove and offers the huge benefit of working even without power. Well done US Stove Company."
ROWDAQERQN,"I've been using this stove for a month and it runs differently for each individual. You have to have an excellent draft...no air leaks in the stove pipe at any point. Use Rutland furnace cement to seal up stove pipes that are not air tight. Having a good draft prevents heat from backdrafting up the feed chamber. I have added a heat sink on the outside of the feed tube to keep it cooler, for added protection. 

I also had to spread the burn chamber a tiny amount to get it to not plug up. Tweaking it makes it more dependable, and will burn longer periods. I like the steady burn and the release of constant heat."
EJQHZ3MLFC,"I haven't fired it up yet, but the review is on the quality.  It was all set up except the base, that went on easily, and the drawers, which did not.  The burn drawer fit fine, the second burn drawer had to be pushed down on the end (on the inside which will probably make all the un-burned pellets fall to the back) and the fire pot what would not close at all.  The tabs on the outside of the drawer had to be pulled out so the drawer would slide in all the way.  The metal on the burn pot is very thick and hard to manipulate.  Hope everything works out okay when it is lit off."
TZYGUDDIZR,damaged and parts missing
2TRZJI4GYG,"The performance of this stove is subject to proper draft and the need to take a little time to learn how control the temperature required for your home. Proper cleaning is essential but is not difficult nor time consuming. 5 minutes a day with a shop vac will do. For me it is easier to maintain and operate than a wood stove. No electricity needed and none of the hassel with cord wood.
I give it 5 stars easy!"
USSYKAF70V,"Instructions are clear except what will happen if you leave the feed chamber open or the hopper open. About the third day it wasn't feeding the pellets properly and I opened the feed chamber Late that evening to see the pellets burning there. I closed that lower cover and left the feed hopper cracked (unlatched) over night. The next morning I found the pellets had smoldered all the way up into the hopper. I removed all the pellets in the stove and found the chutes and hopper were left quite rough from the smoldering pellets. I spent over an hour scraping and sanding the surfaces I could reach so the pellet stove could work again. What I discovered was the pellet basket as delivered wasn't allowing the pellets to flow freely enough. I widened by prying the bars further apart and it ran better. 
The biggest issue with this stove is ash in the burn path builds up (with even the best pellets) and I have to clean it every morning to get enough heat from the stove (I use a Ridgid WD30500 shop vac) I tried a big shop vac to clean it and the hose is too fat. The Ridgid 3 gallon one has a 2"" diameter hose and that will go up the burn path to the 1st corner and remove most of the ash buildup (I bought mine from Home Depot). I plan to run this stove for a long time as we live in the boonies and a power outage is likely. I have a tall 14' flue and I went with 4"" pipe as recommended by US Stove. They have yet to return my request (3 weeks ago) at their site for tips to stop back-burning...Note the glass door soots up before I burn a whole bag of any pellets and the pellet hopper is quite high I use a stool to fill it and I'm 5' 11"" tall."
JIFNQBVJIQ,"bought a wiseway stove when I built my home in 2012 and have had nothing but problems with it.  1. can not regulate the heat sometimes it will flare up to and over 800 degrees and other times like tonight (November 25, 2016) it will not stay lit.  I have spoken to owner/inventor and he sent me a new (smaller) primary burn pot and still nothing but problems.  Gary also told me to spread the burn pot bars apart when not burning or to place a can over the intake port if burning too hot. Again nothing has worked. Also have tried different pellet manufactures but no luck. 2. Pellets get stuck in the feed hopper due to unfinished ridges that catch the pellets and hang them up stopping the flow of pellets also leading to the stove going out when not attended.  Don't waste your money on this stove great idea but doesn't work."
PKCXHEQTNB,"So I bought this a couple months ago and immediately we had a loud high pitch whistling when it would blow heat into the room. Well after many calls and messing with the darn thing, we figured it out. We literally has to take a Sawzaw and cut ""bridges"" between each hole where the heat blows out. It's an air movement problem. Just cut the bridges and it was 95% better! At full blast there is barely a whistle! If you wanted to cut all the holes out, by all means go for it but we just cut till it sounded better. Other than that it's perfect! We love our pellet stove! The reason I am writing this review is to inform because I was spending hours looking up this issue with no answers online so I am really hoping this helps!"
XYRBCQZQUX,"I purchased this and installed it October 2014. This thing ran 24/7 (except when off for maintenance) as I did not hook it up to a thermostat. Kept the entire upstairs of our house at 75 degrees (running on automatic at lowest setting) and only burned 2.5 tons for the whole winter. Never had a problem with it unless someone for got to fill it and it ran out (happened twice while I was out of town). The amount of ash in the tray and build up really depends on the brand of pellet - I ran 2 different brands (2 tons of one and 1/2 of another). The 1/2 ton was a brand from Home Depot - it burned ok, but I had more ash in tray, on the inside, and more build up (caking) in the pot. The other brand (New England Wood Pellet) was better (in my experience). For anyone that says that it goes on it's lowest setting, I will say that getting the dampener set right was key - I got mine set that it didn't burn too hot/fast, and not too slow (should be a lot of yellow flame, but not just yellow and roaring). Once this is set, I cut a small block of wood that keeps the dampener exactly where it needs to be. See pictures.

The bad - filling is a bit of a pain. Small opening and you need to push them back. I do not fill using the bag, I keep a metal trash can with the pellets in it and scoop out what I need - not a perfect solution, but it works."
VNIRICLUQJ,It's been in now for a week and I love it.  I must get a thermostat it was  80 degrees when I got up this morning.  I was looking for one in the box.

W5VO2JKSUM,Takes to lone to start up
ES4NPKX6DJ,"Very satisfied with my 6041i. Heated my 2000sq foot house with ease while connected to thermostat. The stove is easy to use and beautiful.

Unfortunately, the room fan started making a funny noise. US STOVE replaced the part 100% free of charge. Customer service was quick and amazing. New part arrived within a week and installation was a breeze.

The only negative that I can say about this stove is, if you have it on its highest setting, it can seem a bit loud.

I thought this stove was well worth the money and would recommend to anyone looking for an alternate heat source"
U7WU61RWUZ,We loved this pellet stove while it worked for 1 month. It completely stopped working after 1 month & we returned it.
9GNXLWJ8VH,"The bricks were the size advertised so they fit perfectly. I had to cut two bricks just like the old bricks so that was expected. Only two fires, so far good. I was really impressed with the packing. No way were these bricks going to get broken in shipping."
RIYMJBTV2T,"I bought these these firebrick to close off the ends of my propane forge to help retain heat. I used 5 bricks for the job, and 3 developed hairline cracks during the first firing. When I removed the bricks, 1 broke from simple handling and a second almost split at the crack. The 2 other bricks I used have smaller hairline cracks from a subsequent firing, but have not yet broken. By comparison, the 2 firebricks that came with the forge and form the floor were subjected to direct burner heat and don't have any cracks at all."
O1COUFNNNX,"I purchase 2 packs of 6 bricks. Delivery was on time and all bricks were in perfect condition.
I was replacing a preformed firebrick panel that had disintegrated. To replace the firebox paneling with original replacement parts would have cost $850, so I thought these for approx. $70 was worth a shot. Worked out great. Cutting the bricks did not require any special tools. I scored the bricks that I had to cut with a large screw drive and a hammer - chisel style. The bricks broke neatly along the scoring. I cemented the bricks in typical staggered brickwork fashion with special fireproof cement."
RNKJNGPULY,Delivered safely. Easily installed. Took the old cracked bricks out and put the new ones in. Fit perfectly. Work great.
IQKSF762DH,"I suppose for a fire place they might work, for a forge not so much. A year ago I purchased firebricks from HD and they held up well. I needed to rebuild the forge so I went order some more but they had been discontinued so I bought these. They didn't just wilt under the heat, my small forge which barely gets over 2000F melted it. The brick literally became a puddle of goo. 
I had to order some fire bricks somewhere else.

If your wanting some bricks that can take some heat, these aren't it."

That being said, definitely some of the heavier duty liner material I've seen.

OTTSNQ2NXK,"Ordering through Home Depot was a great experience. Stove shipped and was available at Home Depot slightly quicker than stated and found the stove to be crated very well. Home Depot assisted in getting the stove loaded into our vehicle. The stove looks great and installation was a breeze. We have never used a pellet stove before and thought the documentation on how to run the stove was possibly a little vague. After a little trial and error we think we have it figured out. The controls are on the left hand side of the stove towards the back and we installed the stove 9"" from the wall so we have to look at the doc to reference what buttons we are pushing. The fan for the stove is quiet when it's on low but of course gets louder when turned up. We installed the stove in a 1150 sq ft home and although it does heat the home when it's approx. 30 degrees outside I can see where we will probably have to use the higher / louder settings when the temp drops this winter. Only used the stove a couple of weekends but I am pleasantly surprised at how long a bag a pellets last."
HCJWL1KFXZ,This stove is bottom-end. It has not been feeding pellets well and when the fan is on high it almost dances across the room.
VZLMVSGXLM,"this is the same as the p22 breckwell stove. all are now made in china, not oregon. i started replacing parts last year in a 4 year old unit. now the control board at $400 +. can buy the whole unit at about $1200. looking to buy a new castle unit, because i like the reviews!"
RVBGJV6ADW,"I bought this unit to replace a propane stove in my living room. Due to the pipe sizes being incompatible, it took me a year to get everything converted over, when i finally fired up the unit, it wont light on its own. Due to the time I took getting it installed, I was out of warranty. It didnt help that all the paper work says golden eagle stove, but the website is dead, so couldnt get company help. So currently I light the pellets with a torch, and run in manual mode, because it cant re-light itself. the handle broke off one day, and the front bracket that holds the glass in popped off. It would be hard for me to recommend this product to my worst enemy, it is so crappy."

NCD97OVFXY,"More attention to detail needs to be done to the assembly of this product before being shipped. The top of the pellet stove is completely detached and two of the bolts and nuts are missing. The cover for the hopper does not close properly and no way to fix it (they do not close flat to the top, they're indented). You need to notify consumers of the recommendations to go to a 4"" flue kit as opposed to the 3"" recommended for this product if you live over 3000'. Not very satisfied."

TFLF7Q8GHH,After about 1 1/2 weeks the stove froze up and had to take it back to Gallup. The manager there was fantastic and we got a different pellet stove which is perfect.

CHUDC9NQYJ,"For all who are confused with misleading and conflicting information on this pellet stoves and how to configure venting. This stove is a Golden Eagle Stove, go to Golden Eagle.Com. (Monroe model) There you will find straight forward information on how to vent and maintain this stove. The truth, this is a Us Stove (5040), Golden Eagle Stove (Monroe Model and a Breckwell Stove (P22 model). Yes, three different manufactures sell this stove but Breckwell owns them all. My venting off the stove is 3 inch pipe. T/with clean out, 5 feet vertical (inside the home) 2 feet out the building with a slanted horizontal termination cap and the stove works exellent! The control board is that of a high end stove and works exellent! It was 4 below zero I ran the stove at the 2 setting with the fan on high and maintained a temp of 64 degrees in my VERY poorly insulated 1000sqft home. Have had stove running straight for 5 days and have use 3.5 bags of pellets. Always use high quality pellets and keep the stove clean I believe you will enjoy this stove very much! P.S. Fans are not much louder than high priced stoves. Disclaimer...I am not a stove rep, stove installer or stove dealer just a guy that has done alot of research."

E1N5FIKRK0,"I have had this stove since Jan 2012 - 2 full years now. The stove construction and hopper size is good. The heat output is good. It is solid built. It is good that it hold 3 bags of pellets. The design of this stove does have issues - in how the burn pot is held in the unit. I can run the stove on 2 or 3 for only short periods of time. I have learned to limit the air leaks around the burn pot to get better performance. Also, I did get the burn pot kit gasket from US Stove and installed it - this helps some. I empty the burn pot out twice a day - once in the morning and once again before going to bed. I can run the stove at 2 now overnight, but modifications were required. I have had to reduce air flow from the air wash on the glass window - about 75% reduction. I have also replaced the the holding clamps for the ash drawer with bolts and wing nuts, to get tighter seal. Its very important the no air gets sucked in around the draw or around the access door. I have added gasket to both. There are upsides. Parts are easy to find and order online. Many of the parts are common to other US stoves. I also have outside air plumbed to the unit and my total exhaust length is only about 7 ft, including T-clean out and one elbow out the house. Also, I purchased the stove on sale for $900. I have not had issues with US Stove customer service - then sent out the fix kit for free including pdf documentation on how to install yourself - it was easy. But, the kit did not completely fix the issue. Btw, some others have complained about cleaning the burn pot out - it should be noted that you need to clean the burn pot daily or at a very min every other day to remove klinkers - this is normal. The stove does not have an agitator for the pot. Unfortunately, even with my fixes, I have to clean it out 2 times a day. I'm getting a 2nd stove for house in order to get completely off oil soon. I will be reading the other reviews for other stove to see if there is a better performing stove - and at the same price point."
CVFCXBCRRS,"I ordered this online as an alternative source of heat and was very sceptical. The stove's performance was better than anticipated. Once the stove was installed (by a different company) (you will have to get the vent piping, not included with the stove) it provided the space it was purchased for with an ample amount of heat with some to spare. I purchased this stove as an alternative heating source for a large barn I was looking for a hopper size that would not need to be tended to as often."
JOSO5LLDZT,"Not the best stove, i have a hard time with it jamming up pellets even after trying all differnt types. Had the stove for over 2 yeas now. If i lower feed it really does not heat my house"
5ER55MESYM,Had the stove 2 months.  working well.  need to clean pot everyday.  uses about 40 lbs a day on lowest setting.  on the highest setting that works without overflowing the pot it uses almost 80 lbs a day.  kept our old farm house at 70 deg when it was -18 out.  cant complain.
XH89P1HRK8,"Several issues with it turning it self off, as well as the auger jamming. The stove is not user friendly for an older person."
SDU3JVG7M5,This product is poorly built. The auger would not turn to feed the pellets to the burner. The company (US STOVE) wanted me to pay for a technician to come out and diagnose and repair the problem. I only had the unit 7 days so I took it back to Home Depot. You would think the company would pay for the technician since it was still under warranty.

DRUWDFF8CD,"This unit is a waste of money! Stove does not heat well. Mine is 2 years old and has NEVER met advertised specs! My 20 year old one was much more efficient. 
It requires daily maintenance. There is NO customer service from the factory at all…..you are unlikely to even get a return call!"
CKWZILVLWW,"This stove looks great & has a huge capacity. However, even with the factory fix kit, this is a horribly functioning stove. It can barely run 24 hrs without pellets stacking up in the burn pot (on the lowest of low burn rates, no matter the position if the flume) and overflowing into the ash box. After which you have to allow the stove to cool completely, vacuum & detail the inside of the stove in order to get another 24 hours of warmth. Do yourself a favor, do not be sold on looks. If you use the stove once or twice, perhaps for a garage, give me a call, I'll gladly give this mine to you."
Q7FJU4ZGM6,I believe the stove was a returned product and nobody checked it out. First of all it had pellets in it. The wires for the controller were disconnected. The ground wire for the AC plug was not connected. It goes on. I am very disappointed.
Y2JRP0KGGX,"I originally posted in favor of this stove. I'm now in the process of returning this stove. It was tempermental but still less work than a woodstove and a lot less messy. However, it just kept breaking. After replacing the burn pot gasket 3 times, airwash gasket 2 times and the gasket around the door glass, my stove is still error messaging and smoke has filled my home on 3 different occasions.

Any time I had warranty parts shipped there were no directions, If I called in I was emailed directions for a different stove or walked through it verbally on the phone. Which is handy because they are only open during the time I work so I'm writing down directions to try to figure out without seeing the stove and then had to figure out what they were talking about 6 hours after my lunch break.

The only good thing I can say about this stove is the company itself is helpful. Once it was determined that my stove was a lemon they were quick about getting a replacement sent to me. I am hoping the newer model gives me less issues."
PEMXSWCIVC,had problem with understanding feed rate. allso panel looks fake cheap looking !
7QD98IRKW5,Holds 3 bags of pellets no problem. Stove is a quick set up and heats my whole home at even sub zero temps.
GL2LZUISSQ,"Nice unit, shipping was a headache, installation was not bad though"
UEDTKTEGUS,"bought this stove knowing it had mixed reviews thinking the bad reviews were jut a fluke or user error. It is a poorly made stove BECAUSE there is no gasket holding the burn pot into the burn pot holder and no way to put one there. what happens is the air flow is compromised and the pellets do not burn, overflowing the burn pot. I've tried different pellets, I had my technician come out and inspect the stove, he even got on the phone with the manufacturer. Only he knew more about stoves than their customer service did, being such an experienced technician. I now have to exchange my stove. I am going to buy the Englander that Home Depot has for 1099.00 it has a smaller hopper, but my technician recommended that stove as he's had a lot of customers with that stove and no problems.

I bought this stove for the looks, big hopper and square footage. what i learned, and my techie also pointed out, these prettier stoves don't always burn so well. it's true. thank goodness Home Depot has such a good return policy- this is too important an item to get stuck with a dud. I am also going to recommend Home Depot stops selling this one. It's just poorly designed."
TKJWHXSXKI,"My opinion is I just wasted my money. The burning pot fills up if put above the lowest heat (feed) setting. The window blackens with soot and need to be cleaned, along with the burning pot every day. I can not use mine more then a few hours at any given time. I called customer service left a message three times and never heard from them. Sent two emails again nothing. Then called and left a message that I was going to return the stove. That got an email and some parts that were supposed to correct the problem. They corrected the problem for a month then the same problems started again. I will be looking for another stove from another manufacturer. My best advice is to look for another brand because this one fails to perform as it should and the company does not seem to know how to fix their problems"
LORGBNGGWM,"wood not recommend this stove, the pot fills with pellets and will not burn and you have to clean it everyday, does not put out the heat that it should, have to keep it on med, because if you put it on high it fills with pellets and will not brun until cleaned.
and the ash pot is to small does not hold much.. I had a pellet stove at one time I know how it should work, and this one does not cut it...house is always cold... bad thing is,I have something that does not work right and I will have to buy another one....what do I do with this one....."
CBP4L6SYJA,Ordered because of features -- thought I could let it run for days w/o care. Not the case. Unit is very stylish and puts out a lot of heat with good quality pellets. Burn pot plugs and fills up sometimes causing unit to shut down overnight. Ash collects under burn pot slowing combustion. Took about a week to figure out how to regulate the feed rate and damper. Noisy! Arrived with damage to front -- unable to contact mfr on their web site. Would I still recommend/buy it -- Yes!
BDXESJMCYB,First the stove trips the ground fault when auto ignite is used. (my other stove will not do this on the same circuit). The first night i was suprised to see the burn pot was overflowing and filling the house with smoke. manual sugest changing the feed rate ( I am still looking for the RESET TRIM button mentiond in the manual I think they are refering to the low feed adjust) I was able to change the feed rate and adjust the damper. This did solve the burn pot over fill problem but not the smoke. The final straw came when the handle broke off in my hand. All this happened the first day with less than 5 cups of pellets being used. I hope Home Depot will not give me a hard time returning this due to it being a internet only item.
R54MAP0VH1,"Love this Stove it is easy to run, clean and very well made. It heats my hole house that is a three bedroom rancher one three ton of pelet a seson wow Love it You do the math."
GNAVG8G7ES,"I ordered this so I could attach it to my Englander add-on furnace 28-3500, based upon the review of ""EV603"". It is as he says, almost a direct bolt on. Assembly was straight forward and the only modification I had to make was drilling (3) new holes for the left and then again for the right mounting bracket. The original holes left the filter housing just about 1/8 to 1/4 too narrow. I simply drilled new holes slightly down and closer in to the edge of the originals. After that it was bolt and go. I only wish I would have purchased this at the same time I bought the stove."
29GNM3DWKO,Worked as it should
GOFO44G5JP,"Nice product, easy to assemble. Would reccomend."
RUPW5KN3VZ,"So far it does as advertise. But in my situation I have a hot blast stove. The fan motors have oil ports on them. The stove came preassembled. So that being said. I'm fortunate to be mechanically inclined. I had to do some major reengineering to this product to have access to the oil ports. I bought a 30 inch hinge and added in the top portion so i can open half of the top. Also There are 6 conduit opening in the top portion. They are only 2 inches deep. I had to extend two to 5 inches deep to accommodate my condiut for the motors. Then it only came with one plate to cover two of the 6 unused slots. So at work, out of 16 gauge steel I bent a piece that would cover all six slots and this also made it so I could attach it to external sheet metal of the stove as well to prevent rattling cause they don't send a bracket for this purpose. If I had pictures I'd add them. But after all this it seems to work as designed."
6FTCYR4UIC,Very happy with the box.  Easy to assemble and install.  Need to include sealing material for around  the wires to the fans.  The slots at the back of the box work well for installation but leave gaps that allow air flow that bypasses the filter.  I had to purchase a small amount of ceramic insulation to plug the holes.  That should be included with the box.  If it wasn't for the the lack of sealing material I would give 5-stars.
NZIEI8UCTS,I had to adapt add a face mounting plate to match my furnace add on. It worked out fine
P9MQRMKSMO,Good product. Easy to assemble. Expensive for what it is. Saves a lot of time trying to make a filter box
BCACVOQ8X3,Assembled easy and fits
GIF1VBMG46,"Putting this Filter Box together and attaching it to an England Furnace was easy.  I can't imagine any problems with it.  That said, assembly and attachment does require an electric drill (cord or cordless)."
WA5AVDC3S8,The box works great but the first one we received we received 2 left sides and no right side so had to return it. Got second one and still was missing parts. We we're missing the conduit pieces to cover the holes on top but decided we weren't going to try to get another one because we would probably end up with someone else missing.
MTZ06G9IPX,"heavy duty, fit englander add on furnace.  They dont provide enough covers to cover all the conduit cutouts.  To remove the filter requires removing 3 screws - should improve design to allow easy filter removal."

SV93ZKT3KZ,"Bought for a Englander 28-3500 in my basement. All I had to do was flip one of the attachment brackets and it fit pretty well. I used some stove gasket on the top seam to make the seal tight. It has helped with keeping the dust and smoke smell from the rest of the house.

I wonder why someone doesn't make an exact fit the Englander stove? I would assume they would sell a bunch."
FDE3EQP7SF,this product came fast direct from factory. easy to put together. heavy gauge material.

X5OWMFKGYB,"I installed this unit a couple of weeks a go, when it was really cold out side. Since the install to my oil fired furnace, my basement temp has risen 10 degrees from a usual hi 40's low 50's. It is now in the hi 50's low 60's. This has made the living quarters more comfortable (especially on the feet).

When I think of all the years we just blew that recoverable heat out to the squirrels. The only thing I had to do to the unit was to change out the temperature switch from 180 deg on, to a 100 deg on, and 80 deg off. Otherwise it would rarely turn on, for a furnace any way. I don't know how well it would work on a wood stove, but it seems to me it would be worth a try. I am satisfied."

6WWB5CRDD0,The grate was received in great condition and bolting together was easy.  My problem was after only 2 fires being built on this grate I noticed it had sagged almost to where it was touching the bottom of the stove.  I called United Stove Co. and spoke with an agent named Frank.  He was very helpful and understanding.  He readily offered to send me another grate to replace the one I had.   About a week later FedEx delivered me another grate.  I have not yet used that one but I can't say anything bad about the support I have gotten from United Stove which is the reason I recommend this product.

They fit perfectly in the furnace. I had them installed in less then 5 minutes. So far they've been doing the job. The furnace provides a great source of secondary heat to my shop. Keeps the primary furnace from running so much. But as the saying goes, time will tell the true story."

I am raising the temperature in a 30x80 un-insulated pole barn by 10 degrees with one load of firewood. I am sure that I could raise it more if I burned more wood. I recommend this system. Total cost, including both kits, stovepipe, elbows, fire sealant caulk to go around the parts, insulated 4x8 sheet for heat reflector and paint was $182.

DDPDL2LHMV,"I'm old, ultra conservative. Learned this trait from my growing up in the 50's. Our wood stove chimney is 8"" and my newer epa wood stove called for 6 inch. It was burning too hot even at the lowest setting for our smallish ""cabin"" style home. I reasoned our 22 ft tall 8 inch chimney may be the culprit allowing too much draw? Reasoning this out I remembered using these simple cast iron chimney dampers from my youth. Well, this very inexpensive item worked beautifully to enable us to fine tune the amount of chimney draw. Now our newer stove is working as designed with the proper draw. Added bonus: Keeps the low heat setting heat in the stove, not rushing out the chimney! Less wood consumed, longer controllable burns, clean and efficient! Saved me hundreds on a not needed chimney replacement. Very pleased with the product, simple and quick to install.
Home Depot free ship for in store pickup service is Class A. Less than a week with accurate tracking and notified us the moment it arrived! Highly recommended."

5BVKNHDCOT,"I bought this stove to replace an Ashley Circulator that was about 20 years old. I loved the old stove it had been rebuilt and fixed a few times but it was worn out. This stove is a bit bigger BTU wise than the one it replaced. Overall I am happy with the stove. I only have 2 issues with it, the latches for the firebox and ash pan doors are not very well designed. Be sure to wear gloves to open it after it's been warmed up. The firebox door is somewhat ridiculous in its safety features but you get used to it. The other issue is the size and design of the ash pan, it's very small and cumbersome to get out of the stove to empty. The ash pan on my previous stove was much bigger and a simpler design. On this stove when I have a fire burning all day I have to empty it twice a day. My previous stove you could empty it once in a 24 hr. period. Other than those 2 issues I am very happy with it!"
LC24DAPCAL,What size of logs can this wood stove hold and how Long will it keep heat
PROC39WK7M,Has not worked since hooking it up. We have been on the phone with tech support five times. They have mailed us five ignitors and a new motherboard. Still nothing! Worst product ever. Taking it back!
EHDJMKM8XA,Had Pretty good luck. Works great with pellets have had some trouble burning corn depending on the quality of the corn. If the corn has any fines it will plug up the chute all the time. It is manageable though. Dont buy if you are looking for something you want to start and look away.
JRAGM7HZBB,I have been involved with friends and their pellet stoves. This one here is by far the best system although you must clean it weekly. But the heat extraction is unsurpassed by the others I have seen. I own this very stove and would not trade it for any others.
GW5UQG0BCW,"We live in the Mohawk river valley, brrrr

( non insulated 1888 farm house)
Run Non Stop For 1 Week on 3 before cleaning

I am still very pleased with this stove"
6YBFBGZI0B,"I am on my third winter of using this stove. I have propane heat and this stove saves me a fortune. The longer you use it the more you figure it out. The first year I pretty much used the automatic settings. I am now at the point where I am adjusting the draft fan and room fan manually and I think I have it operating at peak efficiency. I'm heating a 1,400 square foot home. I can leave it on the P1 heat setting and heat the house to 76 degrees when it's 20 degrees outside. Obviously it depends on how insulated your house is. Pellet stoves work best in homes that have more of an open floor plan. The only complaint I have is that when the stove is new the paint stinks a little bit when it gets hot. This only happens for the first 3 weeks until the paint gets baked in. Draft fan settings can vary depending on the type of pellets."
H6T4V3FKPF,"It was easy to set up.I don't like how hard it is to move in and out the air adjustment and the two clean outs for the pan, have also side in and out. there is A really high pitch sound that comes from the agitator.I called about it and didn't get A good answer two fix it I also don't under stand the fresh air intake because it still uses in side air"
CHKGZKRFKN,"We have had this model for three seasons now and it has been nothing but trouble. I am an experienced mechanic and I am very good with all thing mechanical, this stove is troublesome. We had to replace the board and a wiring harness 1st year and an ignitor the second year and right off the bat this year (3rd) the ignitor took a dump. I service this stove frequently to include a once a year total cleaning and lubrication of all moving parts. I don't mind keeping things clean and lubricated but this is crazy! If you are mechanically challenged don't buy this stove. Oh yes I forgot the front glass seal is shot too."
2RQNMH6HY5,"I purchased this stove during the summer and installed it myself and I am very pleased with its performance. It keeps my 1800 square foot cape at 68-70 degrees all the time. I clean it once a week, add pellets daily and it works great."
EMLJ2CX85V,"Too complicated, made booming noise in the house, it smoked and could not get any help to corrcet the problems from the manuafature."

OJJ60Z6YKT,"Turned on stove for the first time today 11-20-11 Have heat setting on 1 Outside temp is about 50, inside 64. Stove is burning 1 lb. of pellets per hour At this time I rate the stove excellent Alex"
YFPJCMNZXU,"This stove has been working well and was easy to install. It quit once, but I believe that is normal, and believe I had too much air coming in (like any stove it has an adjustable air intake). Beware to anyone who is thinking of buying a pellet stove and not having any work to do, or that it will be like turning on a gas furnace. It is easy, but takes figuring out a bit, tweaking to get what you want out of it.
ALSO, it does not heat like my 2 wood stoves. I figured it could keep the area I was putting it in warm and it can't keep up with the cold (keeps it in the lower 60's at least). I have the advantage of having had a stove in the very place before, a Yodel Castine, which easily heated this side of our home. But I knew, and anyone purchasing should, that there are too many factors involved to really know how well it will work in your home until you get it-- it's the risk you take. It is running well and putting out good heat, just not enough to be sufficient with all my windows. I guess it does loose a star in my rating because of this-- it doesn't seem to heat as big of an area as advertised. I have a 2500 sf home that is very old, restored, little insulation, but I also have a Yodel Oslo (big) heating the major part of the house, and hoped that this pellet stove would take care of the rest... not so. Not quite the amount of heat I had hoped for. But a good stove regardless for the price."
THVGPT63HH,"Wished it had a thermostat, but still a great product for smaller spaces."
FIXRYY7BRR,"Several design flaws hamper the ability of this stove to perform. First is the right side of the unit needs a large removable panel to get at things. Why? Because maintenance happens and the auger system is garbage. First, the auger motor is seriously underpowered at 0.4 amp. Second, there is no support for the auger at the drop chute end so it churns around rubbing and galling the chute. Third, sawdust will collect at the bottom of the shaft which the auger blade rotates around a brass sleeve. It will frequently jam. I really wanted the unit to work, but that meant modifying it. So this is what I did. Pull the motor and auger out. Grind the nubs on the shaft that snag the pellets off. Insert a 1/2x3/16 nylon spacer on the shaft at the bottom. Reinstall the auger. Replace the wimpy 0.4 amp motor unit with a .7-1 amp 4 RPM CCW unit with a hole in the shaft for the attachment pin. You can get it for $46 online. Now the unit runs much better and will fire up and run with a full load of pellets in the hopper. If the above designs flaws were addressed, this would be a 4 Star for sure. Picture of the original and replacement motor attached."
EOKYRJ89N8,"So far my experience with this has been very good. It’s a great space saver and very easy to install. I have it in my garage workshop. 

It self ignites very easily from one button and the five heat settings do work. The electronics don’t seem to understand the off switch though. For some silly reason it continues to spit out six or seven pellets after you’ve hit off.

Cost wise its great value since all the (expensive) Duravent you’ll need comes with it. 
Quality is better than expected since it’s made in China which was a big disappointment for me. I called US Stove and asked them this specific question and got a wrong answer."
9VOLHIZUHT,"I picked this product because it fit a specific requirement i had. I did not want a free standing stove. I also did not want to disable the fire place if the need to use it ever arrived. (extended power outage, etc.) 
the installation was easy once i was figured out how the tubing connected. the instructions was not super clear. but a few minutes sitting down and studying the pieces, it became clear. I had the install complete inside of four hours. (including locating the best location in the wall to maintain all the required clearances. with the unit running on high all day, the unit is just warm to the touch. the vent on the front is the only area hot enough to get your attention for obvious reasons. the cleaning cycle seems to be every two bags of pellets. But it only takes 10 to 15 minutes to clean. Fill the hopper, hit the button and go about the day.
We are very happy with this unit, the electric heat has been shutoff ever since."
33ZPKBUUA8,"We purchased our wall hung stove from an outside vendor in 2015. The door was damaged prior to shipping and we contacted the manufacturer for a replacement door. We had no problem getting the replacement with proof of purchase. The company was helpful and professional.

We removed and replace the damaged door in a very straight forward process. The installation was not complicated, but the unit is very heavy, so additional help to ""hang"" the unit is recommended. The unit was fired up immediately upon installation to burn off it off, as recommended. 

This unit is located in our vacation home (1000 sq ft) in the mountains at approximately 7000 ft elevation so the weather can be cool in the spring and fall. This unit keeps the home at about 68-70 degrees overnight on the lowest setting with 30-32 degree outside temps.

The unit recently started shutting down overnight. After reading reviews from several sites, we decided that it was probably due to excess pellet dust in the hopper. We have been regularly cleaning the pot and heat exchanger, but not the hopper. 

RECOMMENDATION: set a regular cleaning/maintenance schedule for the hopper burn chamber and heat exchanger.

We would recommend this unit for installation in any similar environment."

89OY6FA2WE,"I have a love/hate relationship with this stove after 4 weeks of use. I love the design, and that it mounts on the wall. Nothing ugly about it. Unlike some other reviews, I've never had a problem with the auger delivering pellets. My only frustration (the bad) is that it takes 3-7 on/off cycles to ignite. Before the first attempt I clean the entire burn pot assembly. If the stove doesn't ignite in 10-15 minutes I shut it down, remove the pellets from the upper chamber of the burn pot, and try again. I note that everything is cold to the touch. I go through this process until I finally get ignition within 5-10 minutes after turning it on. Then everything works perfectly. I suspect I have a touchy Auto-Start Igniter. A neighbor is thinking of getting this stove after seeing mine. I can only recommend this stove to someone who is patient and willing to fuss with it. It is possible my stove's failure to readily ignite could be an outlier."
JM48PBYWH7,"This stove is easy to maintain. Being on the wall it is out of the way. The outside stays cool, which makes it safe for the grandchildren and pets."
TMCRTGOZOH,"Easy to install.  It worked fine for three days, then jammed.  Using premium pellets, so dust shouldn't be an issue in three days.  Cleaned everything, according to the manual, and removed the jam.Still jammed.  So we threw the pellets away, cleared the jam, and filled it 1/3 way.  Good so far."

I Called the company on Monday. They told me it's probably a board problem. Took a week for the new boards and com cable to come. Installed the new control,display board and com.cable.As soon as I turned power on all the LEDs would all flash. I Called the company back.They told it's got to be com. cable. They said they would send a new one .I asked do I have to wait another week to get this cable . Their anwser was we can get it to sooner but will cost you 90 dollars for second day. So I waited another 9 days because of the holiday . Installed the new cable. Same problem all the LEDs flashing .They agreed to send a new stove. After a week recieved the stove Installed the new stove ran for day and half. Started shutting down. Fire would go out. But kept filling the fire pot with pellets and the stove never shut off. Called them back. And their answer was. We'll it's got to be the boards will send you new boards"
T3PUGBUZDY,"The first season the stove worked great, the second season multiple problems.

XY0BSBBPSB,Heats the rooms okay but it never stops buzzing and you have to reset it once or twice a day. It will drive you crazy.
TBBM6EWPKC,"This is a great heater. It takes up very little floor space compared to other units. Puts out enough heat for a small house or out building. Did have some issues with the feed auger. The clip that secures the auger motor shaft is too long and can hit the mount. I replaced the clip with a cotter pin. Also I had to clean the shaft under the auger bushing and apply grease as there was some rust that caused the feed motor to bind. Also apply some light oil to the feed motor bearings. Seems like the feed motor is a little underpowered. Anyway I am happy with the unit and it is good quality for the price paid.
Hjh"
SFBDDXLASX,"The unit nests up in the wall out of the way. I seems safe as the surfaces are cool to touch. Once started, the stove heats up the room quickly. One time the flame went out- needed a little cleaning- rattle the inner parts a little.
I wish it had a clean up ash catcher- for cleaning. Some of the ashes fall to floor as there is no catch tray. A magnetic tray- home made - would solve the problem.
The controls are simple- 1,2 3 4 - no special features such as a timer to shut down unit in milder weather.
There was some silica pack hidden in the combustion chamber- explained reason why unit did not initially start."
Y2V9DUSFFT,"Love the look and feel. It is a challenge to get it to fire. The auger feeder will put to many pellets into the chamber and will prevent ignition. With a little patience I have figured how to get it to ignite, but it is a process."
KGBZ4LA9KD,"I had completed installation of the PelletVent exhaust kit with no problems. Next I attached the flexible 2"" Fresh Air hose to its exterior cover and attached the cover to the exterior of the house. All that was left was to ""stretch"" the 2"" air hose to the air inlet at the back of the stove, a distance of 6 inches through the wall plus 12 inches to the air inlet, which would appear to be 18 inches. I pulled carefully and tried to coax it to ""stretch "" far enough- I was disappointed when it tore. The installation sheet with the 69FAK said it had 2 pieces of flex hose, that should extend up to 4 FEET, but that was not the case with this kit. Now I need to find an 18-24inch flex hose somewhere to complete my installation. This was not worth the price."

USRVTDSZPU,The pipe tube is barely usable and come apart when you try to stretch it.very cheap product and not worth the price. Really disappointed in the quality of the product.
HWIUWMQVCJ,"Flexible pipe is a bit lacking in quality, and screws do not account for the amount of depth needed for application. Otherwise, no complaints."
XJVOHAST7N,just what we needed
O0CE4GBAPJ,Junk
VB39X9F3S7,Not the right in take for my buro wood stove
WU3WEHVL4L,"The quality of the parts is great with the exception of the expandable 2 inch tube. It says they will expand to 4 feet (2 feet each) but that is not the case. At best each one will expand to about 12 - 14 inches and if you try to really stretch it they will pull right apart and will be junk. (yes I did that). So if you need to go more than say 2 feet I would order a separate tube. Even if you only need 2 feet you will still need to order a coupling to piece the 2 together, or I guess you could use some type of duct tape. That being said every other part is really good quality, nice thick black powder coat on all of it. Should last the life of the stove."
Z9Z35YEBHC,waste of your money do not buy
5BYNGCUVKU,Did not fit stove. $5 worth of parts for $60.   What a rip-off
PPCFORUQWJ,This is junk-don't recomend it to anyone-do not waste your money.
JQFOMUUGSE,"Everything seems to work as intended, bought as a present for my father to use with his wood furnace and mom has said it is kept the house much cleaner by limiting the amount of loose ash throughout the house"
VWGVHQ6RQX,"There aren't very many products that fall into this category and this vacuum seemed like it was in the top 50% when compared against similar products. Upon receiving the vacuum I noticed that the motor and canister are solidly constructed (probably a good thing if you're going to risk picking up hot ashes) but that other parts of the vacuum could use improvement. It does do an exceptional job of catching all of the ash and preventing it from getting out into the room.
I do think that the hose is a tad on the cheap side. I've only had it several weeks and the foam gasket on the canister end is already coming out. I also had trouble getting good suction even after a single use. I suspected that this was because I was vacuuming cottonwood ash up, but cleaning the filter didn't alleviate the problem. Finally I noticed that the hose was the issue and that it was clogging up. If you keep the hose clean it performs well but having to knock the hose out doesn't seem to benefit the foam gasket mentioned above.
The dual filters on this vacuum are easy to clean and do a great job of preventing any ash particles from getting into the air. I've also sucked up hot ashes accidentally on a few occasions and the filters don't seem to be harmed by this either.
Overall, I anticipate that this vacuum is going to last a long time and is going to be able to do what it is designed for. I was un-impressed by the amount of cleaning/maintenance that is required to keep this vacuum working on a day to day basis."
U1PEY9HGJM,"I have a pellet stove and was using a small shop vac to suck up the ash what a mistake that was, there was ash everywhere it was on the furniture floor what a mess. I ordered this 6.6 GAL 2 HP Ash Vac and it does it's job. This ash vac does not have the strongest suction I've ever seen but it does do the job without leaving ash everywhere in the house. It suits my purpose just fine. Good for the money."
BJASEHW1LK,I have a pellet stove and I can barely jam the attachment into the dust pan and burner area to clean the pellet stove. This would be fine for a fireplace but it needs different attachments for pellet stove.
HUVTD4CYCC,The vacuum has minimal suction power. For ashes and fallen pellets I just expected something with a lot more power. There is ash remaining in the hose even when the can is not full. This should not be. Maybe look for a different one. But does have good filtration.
GNQJ1M3LDK,"I use this for a woodstove, I was trying to avoid shoveling the ashes at all because of the cloud of dust that this makes in the house. The vacuum works fair for what it is basically a 5 gallon bucket with a very fine filter to keep the ash out of the motor (and the room) and some protection in case any hot embers are sucked in.
My reason for the less than stellar rating is that the filter loads up and then it loses suction with only about 1-2 inches of ash in the bottom of the can. I have to take it out and dump it knock the ash off the fabric filter and then take it back in the house to try to get another inch or 2 of ash.
Note:*** this vacuum does a great job of NOT recirculating any ash into the room, it is really good at that.*****
I can see where it might be great for pellet stoves as they don't make as much debris."
HDPGTXWI7A,We have had a wood burning insert in our hearth for over 10 years. Cleaning the ash and other by products of a fireplace have been difficult to say the least. When I found this product I thought why not give it a try. I have been very happy with that decision. The vacuum handles the ashes very well without blowing dust etc throughout the house. Even if there is still some cinders in the ash the product is made of metal so I don't have to worry. I wish I had found this years ago.
LMJZN3YKAT,So far so good. Picks up the ash from my pellet stove easily. I haven't emptyed it yet since I just started using the stove 2 weeks ago. The vacuum is a bit noisy but works well
2OIFZVGD4K,"Decided to add a pellet stove to the house and learned quickly that needing is highly required. Looked over the reviews and specs for this vac. I have used it multiple times since installing the stove and it has yet to let me down. Great holding capacity, and easy clean out. Long enough cord to reach the stove from the outlet. Nozzle makes it a bit difficult to get around the fire pot but strong enough to pull the ash from the space."
PXXYMV6VF1,"Very little suction, my home upright vaccum hose attachment has better suction than this. It barely picks up ashes right at the end of the hose even with the crevice tool attached. I intend to return this if at all possible.

Great idea with poor execution by the manufacturer."
LZ2C1CHA68,"I bought this vacuum to safely clean my pellet stove and so far I have been very impressed with it. The vacuum has excellent suction and the filter prevents any dust from being released into the air. Its a little smaller than I expected, but it turned out to a good thing as its nice and compact and easy to move around. I would recommend this to anyone"
Q0Z4A6MATY,Shipping was fast to the store and the representative at the store was prompt and courteous when I went in to pick up my purchase.
TRQRQFIDZQ,the vacuum broke on the first use. The power switch did not activate the power. I returned it. Home Deport is a great about returns. I am a solid HD customer
DLRBPEUNEP,"Received the vacuum today and tried it out on both my wood stove and pellet stove. The canister is well made heavy steel and the hose and two suction fittings are adequate. Wile it is safer than my shop vac, it lacks overall. The problem is that it has really weak suction. I had to brush the ashes right up to the tool to get it to suck up everything. It doesn't have enough power to suck unburnt wood pellets . The pellets would go a few inches into the hose and then fall back out. The double filter system does prevent the fine ash from blowing back out if only it had a bit more oomph to take care of heavier ash. I am debating whether to send it back. For the cost of a week's groceries I should have bought the groceries."
LTTDPYFIYL,"The unit is a small round drum and the primary filter has to be stretched over the open top. The filter did not fit well and duct tape had to be used to keep it place! For the cost it is inexcusable to supply such a poorly made filter or at least include a role of tape. Unit performed ok thanks to the tape. Also the instructions recommends the secondary filter be replaced when need, but no information about how to reorder was included."
XJUAYPJQXC,Bought this item on 10/08/12 and it has already quit working. Filter is poor quality Anything that works 5 months is junk and I can certainly see why Home Depot allows you to only return it within 90 days when it carries a years warranty.
FP0BWK9IRG,this product is the exact same as the ASHVAC (SM) except is 25% more in price. It works ok but not for my pellet stove which has more crevices then maybe others. Ok suction. Good attachements. Definately does not get any dust in the house.
OYHQZMQUIW,"I highly recommend this product !!
Delivers just what it advertises !!

two thumbs up !"
DO1NALMKMI,"This vac has less power than we expected and there is an unpleasant odor emission. We wish we'd spent more money and bought a HEPA-equipped vac. On the good side, the ash container is huge and does not have to be emptied often. It's light and easy to carry to the pellet stove."
MV7IRPIRCE,"I Recommend cleaning it after each use
I have been using it weekly to clean my pellet stove"

AN1G3F5DM3,"I Recommend cleaning it after each use
I have been using it weekly to clean my pellet stove"
UWQFCYESPK,I use it every day and would buy another one if I had to.
GV4TILLKPW,Purchased to clean pellet stove. It does a good job. No ash seems to escape into air. The suction is adequate to pick up pellet ash. It was much lower priced than other models I had found. Based on price I would recommend this product.
NHWESTJ9NY,"Have used it several time works great. Keeps the soot
well inside the vacuum, have only dumped it once but
was not hard to dump. I'm well pleased."
CCVMBVMVUY,I had a problem with ash dust when cleaning my wood stove. I purchased this vac. now when i'm cleaning the stove my wife holds the vac hose over the ask bucket as i'm placing the ash in the bucket and it pulls in all of the ash dust. This is an excellent product.
FBSPHJMGGT,"The vacuum works as it says it would.
We are going to create a wire screen on the end of the hose to keep it from vacuuming up the the chunks, which is not designed to anyways...that way it can get all of the ash which is the main reason we puchased this item. And it is doing a much better job than our little hand held vacuum."
VXTTGCLBCV,This is the second ash vacuum we've had and this one is much better than the first more expensive one and doesn't need a bag to collect/ hold the ash. It is less than half the price and works just as good cleaning up the ash from our pellet stove.
XLUGZKTOJH,I have used the vacuum twice on my wood burning stove. It does an excellent job cleaning out the ashes and does not have any dust or dirt that comes out. The filter works well.
VA2CDYCTOP,Being a retired Maint. Engineer I will give this vac. a 5 star rating. I also worked on BIG boilers most of my life so I will also recommend you clean the Vac. after each use.
ULR62KBQRM,"So far, I'm pleased with the way this vacuum has performed. It doesn't have the strongest suction, but it works well in removing the pellet ash from my stove. The wand makes it easy to get into the smaller areas of the stove and there's no dust coming from the exhaust. This ash vacuum has cut my cleanup time in half."
YHLOIU54SM,JUST NOT ENOUGH STRONG SUCTION. SUCTION GREAT AFTER YOU EMPTY CONTAINER WHEN 1/8 FILLED AND YOU CLEAN FILTER AND TRY AGAIN
AZ7KLTNGZE,This product does everything it is suppose to. Its also quieter than my shop vacuum. It retains suction throughout cleaning my pellet stove even after many cleanings
QBQ8GBD0DN,This is a good ash vac. Quick delivery and packaged well. I wish the replacement filters were easier to find. I wish all of attachments were metal also. I still recommend this item.
GGAZFQ9R6D,seems to work good.only used once but did all all that the company said it would.should be built so that all standard options would fit it.
OE95RSEHBR,"Only used it once so far. It did a good job removing warm embers and was pretty quite for a vacuum. I'd recommend it.

Product shipped quickly."
Q0YVMLX4EN,"The vacuum is small so it sits nicely by the stove, and it does a great job getting the ashes. No plugging up and cleaner air."
OEWOXS4S1K,"This is a great vac! I can see how some people would complain that it doesn't pick up large pieces of ash. This probably would not work too well for a fireplace because of the way it is built. I bought it for my Pellet stove and I couldn't be happier! It suck all the ash and unburnt pellets right up with ease. I clean my stove just about every day and I can use this for 3 weeks straight without emptying it or cleaning the filter, the suction is still fine. It's not loud either, about the same as a household vacuum. I was on the verge of spending $240 for the ""top of the line"" ash vac and I'm glad I saved my money and bought this one.

The only complaint about the vac is I wish it had more accessories, or the option to buy a pellet stove accessory kit. Although what I did was go to the local Home Depot and got parts out of the plumbing dept. and made myself a rubber hose accessory and a brush accessory and now I can get into every nook and cranny of my pellet stove. The storage is great too, I just wrap it up and tuck it away in the corner."
CBGGKB5OZT,"I was looking to purchase a vacuum for my fireplace. I have built in's above it that were always full of ash dust when I was done cleaning. This handy little vacum does the job.
The suction is not like a big shop vac but it picks up all the ash (powder) without leaving dust anywhere in my living room. Holds a lot also. We only empty it after we clean up about the third cleaning. Very good Product and can't beat the cost."
MDCHBX6OPM,Love the fact that clean out of vac is long term periodical and clean and simple
BD6B1ZJ6HB,"My only complaint with the vacuum is it clogs very easily if there are any coals larger that about 3/4 inch in size. If your woodstove or insert burns very hot and leaves nothing but fine ash behind, this vacuum should work very well for you. However, if like me you try to burn your stove/insert on the cool side for efficiency and longevity, I would stick with the old fashioned cleaning method of shovel and bucket."
S9O8HGBFMQ,Real pleased - worth the money and all the hassle cleaning!
NOSPFITBSE,Had fan limit like I hoped it would.
JNYU76R0EC,It works great our upstairs is do much warmer than it was

D2ZQLC6OYY,if every online trans was this perfect ? exactly the item i ordered and fast shipping
RIXPACA7XLOCU,One of the bricks in one of the boxes was broken.The only option given was to return the entire box.
R20CHF0V00BWZK,"they look extraordinary , warmth, excellent termination"
RKWJLL5GWFZGU,"Loved the idea. Spent the money on the drum, the lid, the clasp. Literally just finished tightening the last nut and went to put the door on.Hinge broke. No word from customer service yet but not pleased.I hope they make this right and send a door I can use.Otherwise I’m out the $150 I’ve put into this project so far.Disappointing"
R1SZ5H64ZB7B0N,"This was heavier than I expected and slightly smaller than our clean out door hole, but we made it work and it looks awesome."
R3PZ8JYMAA9AF9,I used this product for my Wonder Coal stove that was given to me but I had to buy new parts for it and Amazon had what I was looking for at a reasonable price...
R222YWY64KZ7S2,Cute and easy to keep clean. Suggest multiple coats of hi temp flat black spraypaint prior to use. No rust yet
R1HVDPJVEA17HW,"First part arrived broken, so I ordered a replacement. Second part also arrived broken. No option for a replacement the second time. Very dissapointed."
R3EAXWBEO1XQZH,"3 star review because the stove is the perfect size. The lack of the other 2 stars is because of a stripped out thumb screw on one of the legs, stove pipes and legs were not debured and are very sharp and the chintzy hinge and door clasp design. I would still recommend this stove due to the price compared to other brands and it is a great size, however you’re still gonna spend about 200 bucks and have a product that needs a little TLC straight out of the box. Defiantly not American made"
R2YRRFXRQ2HNZU,"Fan is weak, you can barely feel it moving air through the pipes. It makes a lot of noise when it first starts up."
RYQZR0OUV9PAB,fast service and good price.
R3QBEZD17JXG3,Exactly as advertisedQuick shippingVery satisfiedLooking forward to a toasty winter
R1TVZACCK3IMDZ,"They are a firebrick. For a wood stove, they work. Nothing really special about them. These last me 2 or 3 years in a Drolet Tundra wood furnace, which is run hard every winter in the northeast. Many times in the past, I've had to return boxes of brick that were broken.HOWEVER, the packaging on these is SUPERB! I ordered 6 packages and they arrived in 2 long heavy boxes. Each 6-pack is in a fitted foam HARD cardboard box. If you are getting broken bricks with this type of packaging, your delivery service must be driving over them or something."
R37BYS3X1HQL3X,"These arrived just as expected and were easy to install. I used mortar to cement them in place.After allowing the mortar two days to dry I lit a fire in the stove.Later, I was very surprised to find one of the bricks had cracked.I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if they are simply going to crack due to normal wood stove temperatures.The cracked brick is still functional, so I'll do an update in a few months."
R274OL6ZPJUVGG,"good replacement bricks for most wood stoves . you need to check size to be sure they fit ,you can rent a med tile saw to cut custom sizes . we lost 1/3 of them to breakage so you may want to increase order by 1/3 , but they will replace any broken ones if you return them ,they come in manufacture package and are repacked to ship out .extra packing material will help to reduce brakage"
R392WEOFB935JA,excellent very happy
R16VMJCKLZYTIB,Fast delivery and even faster customer service replies
R1NXK4L5I165YI,6 blocks came not 18.There are supposed to be 18.There are 6 in this box.
R5ZLAWFRFX9W3,My Likes good price easy to assemble does the job. My dislikes door is a bit sloppy on the frame as is draft controller and draft controller is a bitsmaller than I would prefer
R3TLJS5GCYU4QZ,Fit and finish is very poor. I had to file a bunch of metal off the hinges. The door doesn't close all that great because the lip was ground too small at the factory.

R1F0OSNOX217EW,I have two of these now .they are the best pellet stove out there
R3VV8JGDOID6B9,Absolute Junk!! Complete Garbage!! Absolute trash!!These are the biggest waste of money ever. I cannot even begin to express how upset I am with this purchase and that I wasted the money. These things melt like plastic from only minor heat. They lasted almost an hour before being completely trashed.Total s*&t!!
R2XOU7N7BNN8L4,"this thing does work, with slight modifications. i went and bout exsusast tailpipe "" Y"" and put it on the top of the pipe without the section with the guard on it. MAN, once it got hot, it took off !"
R38ZSSEAT9IB0S,"LIKE ANY STOVE YOU NEED TO HAVE A BURN IN IT FOR AT LEAST 4 HOURS.WITH PIPES ATTACHED ASWELL.THAN AFTER THE BURN TAKE PIPES DOW.N.CHECK STOVE FLR LEAKS.WARPING ALL,WHEN ITS DOING THE BURN.IT WORKSWELL IN TENTS MADE FOR CAMP STOVES,HUNTINGSHACKS,SMALL CABINS,PUTS OUT TNE HEAT YOU CAN WZRM OTHER LOGS ON SIDE IF THERE WET.HANG SMALL ITEMS LIKE TOWEL,WASH CLOTH.ON SIDE.EASY TO SET UP.YOU CAN ADD OR MAKE STURDER LEGS.THIS DOES IT FOR CAMPING HUNTING THE OUTDOOR LIFE."
R3FETPZNL6AY4G,"This chimney clean out door is a good steel quality. Jus to protect from rust I applied two coats of a stop rust spray painting and looks very nice. To attach it we had a problem in fixing it with the screws, so how it fitted tight and perfectly to the opening we have, we just filled all around with a clear silicone and it worked perfectly. I also want to add that even if the door does not have a latch to close it, it still closes well."
R3TT9X5QGBMV33,Great fit works perfectly.
R2TYYG1NFW6HUS,"Very durable,nice look."
R31KAOGWCXKRBF,"We bought this to make our own wood boiler to heat the pool. all the parts came in, perfect condition, easy to assemble."
R1WY0HHTWJJ2CN,It worked great for about 2 months then started making an awful noise.After that it stopped working all together.Do not waste your money on it.

RBJGSSLTN647Y,"Its excellent product, my brother highly recommends buying again! (They were part of his gift)"
R16690MFMJUAMF,Used 1 week and a brick cracked in half because it was against a very small single burner forge unreal
R3V4LYSVD7JNY8,Worst stove ever bought.No air flow.Bad design.Pisses me off is this stove is discontinued.Why didn't they tell me that before I bought it?I bought this stove because of another stove they made is discontinued and can't get parts.Unhappy customer.
RHYPJBKYNBG6M,"There is a 1/4 inch gap between frame, and door.Air, bugs, whatever can easily pass from inside chimney to basement.I do NOT recommend this product.I used black permatex silicone to seal.I feel this product is junk."
R170HJL7UM7DS0,Much heavier then explained.
R1JABNRMSRQ7BQ,I just stacked them on end in a square patter and put a briquette grill Over the top to elevate them towards my grill surface of my fire pit.Packed well for shipping but cost was a bit much.
R2Z131RJJURKBT,"This is a great little stove, 18” long and chimney pipe is 2”I’ve included pictures next to a 5 gallon bucket for size references"
R385BLVXQ3JOHW,Exactly how they described it and works great. No real handle for the door but works just fine for the money I purchased it for.
R22VYYE3BEEO1V,I love the steamer! It’s very cute for a country themed house. Have had a little bit of issue with it rusting on the inside edge.Overall I give it five stars!
R1DGL5CDIZ7MVQ,"I would have given this a much higher, 5 star, review but it was missing the screws to hold the door on. I would have returned and bought a different one but I needed as a repair for closing the sale of my house."
R4X655X05HPZD,Fit exactly as described
R4U5LQ10UHUAW,Put it in my shop have had that thing hot and it’s still together
R2OWOGVNVPIP2T,"I really wanted this item for a long time and I finally ordered it, unfortunately it looks nothing like the photos. The casting is extremely poor, so poor you cannot even tell it is a chicken. I ordered a replacement hoping maybe I just got a bad one but the next one was more poorly cast than the first. Total bummer. I am returning both because putting one on my pellet stove would just make me mad every time I walked by it."
R2TB9TN5P7X8EB,Works good
R35TIV4QG7W3RS,We were happy to find this for chimney clean out in our basement after original had broken. Brought with recommended black chalking.Worked out well
R9BTVITN62Z51,"Light, clean, effective, and easy to handle."
R30VA0P257EAC3,"So, wanted to write this with pictures as there is some back and forth with this for a 30 gal drum.Works perfect, just use the bottom of the drumFor the flue collar, it is rounded more for a 55 gallon drum but works just fine.What I did was add some Rope gasket under the collar.Basically added some gasket cement first between the opening and bolt holes.Then added the gasket on that and some additional cement on top of the gasket.Made a good seal.Also I used 5in pipe so used 6 to 5 (no crimp) adapter.I added a 12""x24"" piece of 20ga steel to the bottom (just for added support since I don't use a grate but I do add an inch of dirt)"
R2M6FJI5TXTOJW,Works great
R1ANL95CDZ20S5,Good
R2CD1Y7E5ULB80,"I have a 25 plus year wood stove that I have never changed the Bricks.it is a high quality stove and I use it LOTS, sole source of heat in my 2k sf home.the original bricks were made in Canada as they are embossed with Canada on them.these bricks are all cracked to the point I thought it is a good time to change them, especially seeing the cost of the replacement bricks being what I consider a reasonable price.the new replacement bricks are significantly lighter, less dense, noticeably lighter than the original.I had to notch the top of the new bricks to fit under a lip that holds them in place in the stove.I knew I would have to notch them when I bought them.they were easily notched with a hand held rotary grinder.one brick cracked in half no where near the point I was grinding, not a big deal. I also had to cut one in width and it cut without problem, so I am not sure why the other split for no good reason on my part.my only concern is the much less dense construction of the bricks.as this is July I will not be using the stove for a few months to determine how they perform, and how they will hold up.not sure where these bricks are made as there is no indication with the product.they did replace the old bricks, fit in fine, were the exact same size as the old bricks, the size specified in product description.my questions are :""where are these bricks made?"" and ""how will the density effect performance?"" and ""how will they hold up?""time will tell.I would have rated the product higher if the bricks had been the same density as the original. the new bricks are very porous, the original bricks dense and smooth.the less dense construction leaves me thinking they will not hold up as well as the original, and only hope they provide a safe and effective liner for the stove."
R11BFD6G1YZH3,"Seemly like its made well, we have yet to install it and fire it up. We will play it safe and line the door. Will up date later on performance....."
R1LFP45MBNAZC8,Great for custom fire pit.
R1K1J4JSZS7HGN,"Recieved badly damaged both box and stove. Looks like maybe it washit by fork truck, it cracked the front where the door would attach. Will be returning stove and just get a refund not a replacement."
R1615ERGNWVW3I,"5 of 6 bricks were fine, 6th one was broke in half and a corner broke off too. Box was not damaged in shipping either."
R24LB9T1KV86V1,"Solid cast iron product.Just installed yesterday under small rain. The screw head has slight rust over night.I believe it is normal. I just have to apply some black heat paint later. No issue. No more open fire and no more complaint from fire department. This kit transform a dull barrel drum into a nice looking energy saving stove / heater / fire pit. If the price could be $35, it will he five stars."
R284PTK0NKWL8L,Great all around
R2ADDU944KGQKZ,buy when you can
RRM842TZ5EKOK,have not put togather yet but looks fine

RNF5MN8B32OA4,"Fit right into the chimney opening.I did have to drill a hole on each side using a masonry bit.I used 2 concrete anchors which were a little awkward to install since the power drill or screw driver would not fit into the 8"" hole.Was able to get a good grip.I used PL Max premium sealant around the edges although I won't know how it holds up through the chimney use until winter time.About a 20 minute project."
RDBKY730H279S,"Loved how bricks were packaged, show foresight."
RBUK87QNT8NUU,great pro
R2HWU0JG2D6JEX,Total waste of money.Does not at all function like a proper wood stove should.
R2DSRWI3RZIOPG,perfect fit and works good.
RH37TIZDUB7W4,The package was excellent there were six brick per box and each box had very good insulation around thebrick to protect them . Not one brick was broken very nice.
RLRZC4A0WISO9,"It’s Sturdy and a good value. I would have given a five all around, but it does require chipping off some of the old mortar before installing. It’s a good idea to buy a concrete chipper and the dap mortar caulking that is suggested by the amazon prime app."
R1M2A225OM90LW,Not used for forging they melt
R2BYCMDPGXXCP9,"Okay, right off the bat, when I tried to start a fire in the camp stove the fire did not light, it always smothered out. So I had to stop and think, ""how do I light my charcoal bbq pit?"" So I looked at my bbq pit and realized that the stove doesn't have enough ventilation. So I drilled 5 holes in the back of the camp stove and it fixed the issue. Fire is roaring and I can keep feeding wood in it as long as I want to and it never goes out again unless I put it out. Idea's that work! Add a little black touch up paint and you are good to go. I have it 4 stars because I had to drill 5 wholes in it to get it to work."
RRP5HH9PC0BD7,I needed something to hold the foil on the bottom of my oven. These did the job.
R20UK12IGSZUJ,"Use these in my smelter.. My steel crucible turns red hot, so I'm probably just below ≈2500F. Bricks line the bottom.. No breaks after much, heavy usage. Great purchase."
R2O1BMSVWRH2YO,Sent back. It came broken.
R362S3M6VR2P51,"Very good quality and as described. I removed a very old, rusted clean out door (see last picture) and had no issues installing this. I decided to give it an extra coat of rust retardant black paint (see two pictures prior to installation - first is how it looks out of the package,second is after painting) to increase longevity and then installed it with a set of concrete screws (pre-drilled) and industrial adhesive. I noticed that some people stated the door didn’t close tightly and didn’t have a latch; I didn’t find that issue - though the latch is a simple gravity notch latch, it holds reasonably well. The door isn’t meant to be a sealed tight, so I found the very slight gap more than reasonable for the purpose."
R22W05ZBYC384X,The pipe on the stove was very small and it clogged with soot very easily (like the first night we used it). The clogging lead to it being super Smokey in our tent.
R2Y8DJ8WE254H2,"Created my drum wood stove 2 years ago and used it for 2 winters. The hardware has held up, but not the paint which is not surprising considering the heat. Nothing a little High Temp BBQ paint won't fix.My one comment:The vent supplied does not allow nearly enough air into the stove when starting up a fire. Even adding my own vent in the bung port on the drum is not enough when starting a fire. I do not like leaving the door open and walking away so my solution was to add a second position to the door latch to allow more airflow when starting up the woodstove. Woks Great!"
R2VXU3ECEFJ5EY,Nice quality.
R2SYFWJW2UJ6AH,"Perfect fit into the 8"" tube."
RMXPG57EHBB7X,Door latching was made poorly.Measurements are off so when the door is closed it is crooked and leaves a solid 3/16 inch gap around the door.Ordered a replacement just in case.Same thing.Product not useable based on defect.Shipping is super quick but not really helpful since product is defective.
RRJU5GKQVZENU,"Looks OK, the connection at the top wasn't close to being what it should be. Paint burnt off with first use so I'll have to repaint."
RZVAHIQ4X20KO,"Packed well, but they shouldn't be referred to as ""fire bricks"". They are just bricks and when put in the fire they get discolored, split,and melt... yes... melt.I honestly didn't know a brick could melt. They also break easily."
R2Z99HLHLN3JN4,"I used these to replace the firebrick in my gas forge I use for knife making. My old bricks lasted 3 years and only had to be replaced because the flux used in making forge welds degraded the brick over time. These were very light, grey in color, and very porous like concrete paver stones. They melted in than 30 minutes in my forge."
R3JGK3R2OGSXRS,This item came packed very well. No breakage at all. I have used them multiple times to line the bottom of my smoker. It allows me to keep the coals which helps with relighting wood as opposed to putting it on a raised rack.
R71J4PDH57EOY,Worked perfectly for the wonder coal stove of my mother's.Yeah.
R2Y4K9RIFZODJR, Stove is awesome would buy 50 if I could so easy to set up and burns great I got the14 would definitely recommend the 18 for cutting convenience it keeps my tent at about 70 degrees in 25 degree temps
R1S30I89NTUKCZ,"Great Idea, very poor construction. Hopper box not square, corners of lid split, almost no temp control due to misalignment of holes for damper, do to the misalignment the holes are never fully closed or open. When I contacted the manufacture I was told to call back in a month. I have the ability to address these issues but shouldn't have to."
R2QZUXS5BMBMSE,No cheap welds or materials here.The product came looking just as described.Weighty feel with good welds.Used it for half the season and no wear yet.
R3G131PF7VACJ6,Propane forge.Not that hot.Melted.I'd have a hard time trusting these in any mission critical application.
R3KZD70PL5S9DE,"This will last a lot longer than the usual steel barrel.I drilled all of the holes out to 1/4 and bought bags of 1/4bolts for assembly.I slid a heavy steel water tank inside of the steel barrel to act as a burn box.It has been burning fine for 6 years.I have the double barrel setup and capturetwice as much heat.the upper barrel will last a very, verylong time."
R1ONSFGHA4ZB3X,"Cannot keep a fire going in this stove. It goes out whenever I close the door even if the vent is wide open, and if I open the door the smoke backdrafts into the tent instead of going out the stove pipe. The fact that the stove pipe is off center, and is only 2 inches in diameter I think is the culprit. If they fixed these things I think it would work."
R27IU35TIWG2IS,"Looks great, easy to install & rock solid."
R27M7ON1BTMNP0,"They came packaged nicely and are easy to score and snap with a sawzall, but they aren’t heat rated to the extent the manufacturer has mentioned in the comments. I put them in a 5kg propane foundry that I melt copper with to replace the original fire brick that came with it, but I was doing a copper melt yesterday and in 30 mins, when I pulled the crucible out, I realized that I had a glowing puddle in the bottom of my foundry, which I thought was copper that fell out of my crucible.Only after I shut it down did I realize that the brick completely melted! Copper melts at 1980° and there’s no way that I can get significantly hotter than that in this foundry, so I would reserve these for something with much lower temps."
R1IGK7ETNZ3DOV,Saved quite a bit of money turning a barrell into a wood stove.
R2UNIYEHP86011,"This are awful. They melted....MELTED, and became a liquified crystalized black glass.They RUINED my stuff. Cost me $200 +the cost of these crappy bricks. Can't return BROKEN BLACK LAVA GLASS!!! DO.NOT. BUY."
R2L0OYVTQO8S99,"I like the replacement for the first item I bought, always give people a second chancethank you even if you don't know them!"
R39WW5QWY4S4I0,"All in all, this thing is cheap and doesn't work. I never had a stove return more smoke into the room. We tried everything.I waited for an entire season to review this hoping that maybe there was a learning curve and we'd figure it out but that never happened. Spend a few hundred more and get a good one."
R2A87EWJRYLOJT,"Our furnace goes thru these about one per year.This one is super quite and bolts right on the exhaust blower assembly, part # 80495 (Key #9 in owners manual parts list)."
RUBEOD4ZZ5W9,Satisfied
RUHKO6ITBBSGZ,"These grates are horrible, as are the ones that came in the stove. The first one melted through half way through the season. This one warped so badly after about 5-10 uses that you can't remove the ash pan without removing the grate. Very disappointed, especially since it's so pricey."
R2L49ORVNFNUSY,Door is nice and heavy. The legs don’t fit exactly on the 55 gal drum. Added a couple washers and that fixed it. They also include some extra hardware nuts and screws.
R1QOFQTLVF7Y99,Worked good. Doesn’t fit perfectly on the 55 gal drum. Added a couple washer and made it fit.
R1KRH7TN81G8OK,thank you
R1HWDMEQW1T2I5,Great product with the exception of the cheap hardware. Do yourself a favor and buy quality nuts and bolts from a hardware store you will be happy you did.
RGWN0C3I900SU,Looks great and works awesome.
R2B2463O82AIC5,One of the bolts were missing from the door
R1E3WUT6TV5YK4,"Replaced the old, cracked clean out door. A perfect fit."
R3TXTTB81QRINS,The US Stove part#891139 was brokenWhat are you going to do about this?
R3EPOBVDBUCSVN,"We wanted a small wood stove just to take the chill off our cabin in the early spring. At first glance out of box I thought it was too small, but it does a great job. This stove comes in a 14"" or 18"" models and it is light weight enough, about 22 lbs, to take hiking, or to use anywhere that frowns on open fires. I would recommendthe 18"" model"
R3IV7GPS60WOG1,"They are expensive, seem to be the only ones available in this area. They are a good product."
RKI3KRESAB19S,Works great and is quieter than the original.
R13R5XL9JJ2A9U,👍
R3LF83KG27K3K3,The feet fit like absolute garbage. Even in there add photo I can see the misjudged angle of the foot for a 55gallon barrel. This makes the hole thing tips and not ideal for a good looking fit. Cheap cheap cheap.
R1LT1VY6Q75XNQ,"This is the single worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. How, after centuries of humans using wood stoves could something so poorly designed, manufactured and assembled be foisted on the public? Smoke rolls out the (gasketless) door, and the seams and the bottom. Firebox is clogged from the factory with a fire-wool mat that requires complete disassembly to remove, damper won't adjust as it comes pinned in place from the factory (obviously this is a workaround of some sort) and the draft is at the front, not the back, of the firebox....right by the door. And I'm stuck with this made-in-China beauty.So instead of spending $200 and 10 hours to rebuild it I'm going to buy a different stove from a quality company. Then I'm going use this thing as a boat anchor."
R35PLNVAXI4RNY,"I built a double barrel stove for my desert place 4 or so years ago and use it every weekend. We burn in it from sun down to sun up and sometimes all day long too. It was a game changer for us. I use it so much, I decided to build another (my 3rd)."
R808L13B4EVNJ,These were great made the stoves and they look like store bought
R1BF0X1XRLIOGY,Not as well made as what i use to get. They are way more poresand break easier than what i use to get.
R2C37BZZCGSW4S,"Absolutely pathetic.The chimney is much to small for the firebox. I was burning kiln dried split pieces of pine, bone dry, and all it wanted to do is smolder. Not nearly enough chimney to let the exhaust out.Don't buy this, trust me."
R2XOWKVRR56YG0,Holes in the box and all hardware was missing.....!!! Useless
R1HRGU9XXMEKYK,Product as described.
RRSHHA1I1QRBF,Great stove for the barn
R3DGX4WTO5MNRW,Sucked Chinese junk
RQ9KV1803ED0X,It heats very well DO NOT USE CORN
RYIHV9Q5M62RK,Fit perfectly
R2D04XRUE4P3WW,The grate warped and bent after 6 weeks use and we don’t even have that hot of fires.
RWWHA1T4J12K6,I actually used this as a door for a firebox on one of my 3 smokers.Worked very well for the money.I would definitely use one on a barrel stove. I think it would work quite well.
R2939EY97UQBLO,works good
RADER3D1URPEZ,good value
R3H36F56L6MND4,Bad quality
R3SDJ7MGG3ZET9,"Got this part at the end of December 2019. Delivery was fast and it was easy to install. Within a few weeks, started to notice a lot of buildup in the cup, now today March 15, it does not work at all. Got 5 years out of the last motor. Will have to get another one."
R2LSIWBV7MAOCZ,I installed this part after much strugglewith trying to install myself.....it totally failed to operate after two days!!!
R9JMO1V0KDXGT,Perfect fit
R1P7M12QQJBJB4,Works great
R26DRHCQI8BCJF,Do not buy these they crumbled in our coal stove and did damage to our stove ! Badproduct!!!!!!!
R2SET6J61FJ7VA,This pellet stove is great.perfect for heating a remote cabin or shop.No electricity needed which is cool.
R2Q8BLNQJTG90K,The grate was just what I needed
R1HOKCB78LV3T0,Came all in tact! Super great! They DO melt how we after about 30+ minutes as a blocker.
R1ZJ59U6W07B0U,I really like the design and I use it for simmering spices.
R2IRBV9M2M41O6,Was a perfect fit.Went in with no problems.
R33A8DJCWRVIOV,Worked great in the bottom of my cast iron stove!
R20L7PO0TLGL4I,Overall the stove is well built and NOW works great. Most important cure this thing (first fire)outside or open all your windows. There is a lot of burn off from the coating. First take the top off and remove the insulation blanket with gloves....toss it. You will find an iron platethat the blanket was resting on take that out. What I did with mine was cut it so there is about 8 inches in the rear under the flue. You need that piece there to prevent flames going up your pipe. I also drilled to quarter inch holes directly in the 8 inch piece to help with draw. I removed the damper and installed a new damper 12 inches up from the stove top with a 24 inch long pipe and spark arrester. Works like a charm.
R3BFLVMOFE9790,I love my chicken.
R2T03A9C7LCQUH,Works great
R2ZJAJXR2H8GWW,Just as described
R3K4Z0M9NRP7K7,"Blower is great. 5 minutes to hook up, house is heated."
R13DUZVS3R6SFM,Have to replace every couple years as breaks down in middle
R1K35KA04BITVM,Worked great in my wood burner
R1J7CHFTEUFF2O,I’ve bought 3 and the last one cracked 4 slots. Other than that seems ok
R1VXS3FGWBXDMZ,good value
R1KS25T8XGVAX1,"Our wood stove is super small and she sits perfectly on top. She is small, so if you burn a hot stove you are going to need to fill her daily."
R2207WQQPBN5F3,Works great
R1BG31PE0KUHYB,Both package and shipping box were damaged in shipping. Nuts and bolts were loose in cardboard box.Missing 12 bolts and 18 nuts. Main parts were ok.
RVGO61WJG8K7F,"Don't understand why everyone is having problems with this , I have burn this hard hot and heavy for a month and had no issues whatsoever with it. I have used it 24/7."
R1YY5R7S2QF5NA,"This is a backup part, not in service yet."
R2RXAKFA6TSYE4,Work s good
R3RRU7B8RVXH89,Great
RDQTU4S00VTQ7,"Plug and play, and upgraded circuity from the original. Has kept the house warm all winter long"
RBUOQ7GST6HRT,Best fire bricks hands down! And really well packaged
R23M5GGV4UK7OL,Everything went together rather simple. Damper collar could be a little taller so the pipe fits into it a little deeper but other than that great value for the money.
R5OOWCVLY4VE,"Last year I bought a second (or third?) hand American Harvest 6041 pellet stove. The distribution blower always sounded like a vacuum cleaner. Back in early January, it started squealing occasionally, so I bought an spare fan assembly just in case. Last week it started making noises I can only describe as a banshee fighting with a wraith - god awful screeching. After removing the motor, I was able to use 3 in 1 on it, and it quieted down, back to it's vacuum cleaner levels.Well, I wasn't trusting it, so I replaced the old fan assembly with the new. Had I known how QUIET the new one was, I would've just replaced it. I can barely hear the motor run. In fact, the only sound I really hear is the air blowing thru the heat exchanger.There was ONE problem. The packaging for the new fan assembly really SUCKED - bubble wrap around the fan assembly, was NOT packed firmly in the box. In fact, the plastic cooling fan for the motor was broken during shipping. I was able to swap out the one on the old fan, however, I wasn't happy about paying $165+ for such a poorly packaged item that had a broken plastic part. One star removed for that."
R24ERQUQE2VJGI,"I've had this stove for approx. 6 months with no issues. Now it's an issue every 5 minutes it feels like. Customer service is an absolute joke and incredibly unhelpful. I'm so frustrated I don't want to go into all the details but I bough it from TSC for $1,000 or so and regret it every second now. Please do yourself a favor and find a different stove company to go with. 'US stoves' is trash."
R28H0CYVVX2JKW,Pefect size for my wood stove
RHSA4TVZSTOEG,"Good value for the product,Correct size for my fireplace, fast delivery."
R1P5LVMILIEX2,Casting were a bit rough. An hour with the angle grinder took care of that.
R2HF7V910PVW85,"Items are priced great!However, upon arrival one grate was missing one leg completely.Contacted the manufacture and they promptly shipped out a replacement at no cost."
R2FLCS2T0MSWQV,I'm in love with this stove. It let out heat like wood stove but so much easier to use.
R3UO34M68776BH,Bought to make maple syrup boiler.Works great!Like the fit of the exhaust tube-snug but not too tight.
R7X1ZXWMYDH0Q,Cheap design and will fail with only few firing of stove.
R1JL4W8C7GT8PC,Life expectantly is about three years. This was the best price I could find on the internet.
R2FNGK8DN0C1KX,This was the best price I could find on the internet.
R102SXQ2II0I8P,Great product I've bought alot of them but recently they were sending me broken one no problem with the return just the hassle of having to wait for a new one I would definitely recommend this product tho
R6Z8NU1AS5TLI,Fits my stove just like the old one.Hope it lasts as long too.
R2VBM5MAAHV4S9,Never opened it
R33MFQQ5JOE6AQ,I would not recommend these fire bricks for use in with a propane forge. I placed these bricks at one end of the forge and two of them cracked in half from the heat. They are all now very brittle and crumbly. I recommend different bricks that are rated for high temps.
R3O5Z9SBYIV4LU,Fits like new
RLVTPNA9BHWHB,"Well adjusted, and still bears the weight well.🙌"
RNXLV6ARK0ITA,I used this to heat my garage and it works perfectly....
R37EW4R5A8H2ER,Very very small. Emits a strange horrible order when used. So disappointed.
R12BRNLVWYCH43,"Fast free shipping, Fits perfect, appears to be original equipment and a lot less $$ than buying direct from manufacture"
R2KE33G3SX3SE9,"Very simple to make. Have been using it to heat my garage, puts out plenty of heat. Very pleased with how it turned out and kind of fun tending the fire."
RBWJ48IMHNU5T,not made as well as the old ones cheap metal today
R2ZD0U4I5EPB8K,Only issue was my shaker hand didn't fit good new shaker was thicker but nothing a grinder can't fix. Ash pan works again hated having to shovel out in bucket while my old on was broke.
R3RKRQ3UABISVM,"I was simply impressed with how well they are packed and protected in the shipping box.Oh yeah, the fire brick is perfect!"
RH93HEW2GQAF1,"It totally worked..!Kept us warm in a canvas tarp tent in 20 degrees..Was nice, boiled water and heated up pastries like a champ..Only issue was getting up every hour or so to put more wood in it when the tent got cold, rigging up a damper might help with that and it's way heavy with the stock flue and legs, almost too much to sled pack.."
R2YZFJ7NCADC1E,Well built!
R3EKPST0WGEFJR,Could use better instructions but cast iron parts are going last year's longer then the barrel
RGDFHTLQ73183,Fits and works

R2HV60O0GRTCDO,"Didn't work for me.I used it 7 times in 3 weeks,nothing.I was hoping,but it didn't seam to do anything!"
R3O2IFGN46MXQL,No tools needed to install.
R1FM4HCBSVGGP4,Our new fireplace grate is great but too high off the floor of the fire box. We ordered these and put a few under the grate to fill the gap since we had no way to cut the grate legs down. Worked great for that.
R3BBR567C1R6S4,Just as described! The packaging ensured that the bricks wouldn’t be broken.
R3FCK7G0XAN2RQ,We just put these in our stove and they melted. I chose these based on review's and the temperature threshold. For us they were not successful.
RI1DRTJ93RDBH,Excellent wood stove.Puts out a lot of heat for its size.Did not smoke at all.
R8I98HQ16R3J8,after2weeksgrateswarpnothappy
R7T3DGDI3PL0N,easy to install and a great stove! good price you just need a barrel. we have the barrel stoves in all of our garages because it puts out a lot of heat but you can't build one until you have this kit which is easy and works great. Great quality for the price and would recommend buying if you need a stove.
R38HA800ZF7DRT,I wish that I would’ve bought this three years ago it is fantastic the wood burns all the way across it . evenly .it’s wonderful
R2WAIJLWCCF1U4,Used for a wood furnace
R3GI9TE908C6HT,The agitator fork has already deteriorated when I just started using this unit end of October 2019. No warranty when I was promised I would have one per Amazon manager.

R3ROGHMT766U8O,Does not last. Waste of money
RUKKT1ENHH0PT,Grate will deform from heat. Usually have to replace it once a year.
R1M42E400HG66R,Seems like a solid product but received broken. If order again i will update when i get the new one
R22507JA27NSUT,Works great. Installed in less than a hour.
R2KJGD3DN0JXWX,"I got this when the price dipped a bit and jumped on it. Nothing was broken and all of the parts were there. Got my 55gal barrel and anyone with modest DIY ability will find it pretty intuitive to assemble. I used a drill to make pilot holes, then used my jigsaw with a metal blade to cut the holes. Used a brand new metal drill bit for all of the screw holes that need to be drilled. I also bought the fireplace/stove cement for between the pieces and barrel so I would have no air leaks or embers finding their way out. Need to do the first burn to clean out the oil residue in the barrel. Once the paint burns off I will paint it with high-temperature paint to cut down on the rusting. May add a stovepipe and spark arrester to the damper and will definitely use 4x4wood under the feet to keep heat transfer from cracking my cement patio."
R319GBH6TSOK8F,"Cute, light, and does the job of adding moisture to my home when the wood stove is used."
R230KSL4WV66OQ,Fit perfect went in easy
R3UJ0W4UT4G5H7,Good kit. Solid and easy to put together.
R2NQI3EHMB3UT5,To anyone using the older version of this combustion motor keep in mind that the original unit had two parts included with the fan. The inner gasket which could be removed without removing the larger gasket.This unit does not come with either gasket and is ONE piece. Meaning if you planned a motor replacement around just the inner gasket you will have to replan for the larger one and the bottom bolt this unit is next to impossible to set like the others if you don't get it on first.Otherwise it is running great in my stove now. Just keep in mind you need the large gasket for this. Only way.
R26FXU1ELF553,"I installed this on a US Stove 1457 wood furnace.It bolted right up.Hooked up the electrical, and unit works great.More air flow than the original fan.I wanted this sealed bearing model over the one 80230, that needs oiled every 6 months.I use the filter box, and it is very difficult to oil the fan with this on.I'm very happy with this purchase.When the other fan goes out, I will eeace with this model.My stove was purchased in 1999, so 20 years on original fans."
R2K014X0QYJ8TI,"Easy to install, perfect fit andnice and quiet."
R3473E286DRIUX,Great project for heating a out door pool andHaving seating in a semi circle to enjoy the fire. I really like the design on the front door.I’ll follow this up later in the year when we can set the pool up.
R1IHG045TXKFA6,Worked great to make an inexpensive wood burner

R3I88CBENHG42C,"Anyone purchasing this pellet stove I suggest you read my review in its entirety along with some other informative input from others to obtain the best results with this product.I first started the stove with a propane torch per instructions and it fired up easily. (Be prepared for burn off smoke for roughly half an hour so either fire it outdoors or set fans strategically to exhaust.) The thermometer climbed to approximately 675 degrees and the unit gave off fairly comfortable heat. Before retiring I ""opened"" the draft slightlyto slow down the burn rate. (This sounds counterintuitive for anyone used to a wood burner.) The next morning it appeared the fire was out but after inspection of the Primary Burn Tube there were still embers. I then removed the Secondary Burn Plate allowing ash to fall into the Ash Tray, poked the primary burn basket with a long screw driver and it was back up and running though not to the previous level. By the morning of the third day it was extinguished and we were sorely disappointed. Reading the User Manual under ""Tuning Your Stove"" I removed the primary burn basket and widened the gaps between the tubes (And I believe this is something which should definitely be emphasized). I cleaned the stove with a Shop Vac, though in hindsight do not believe it was entirely necessary, replaced all parts and fired it up. This time the temperature rose almost to the maximum of 900 degrees though I backed it off first. As I needed to leave for some time I lowered it further and upon return it was functioning perfectly. The following morning required some attention to return to a comfortable operating temperature. So, all in all, to this point I am pleased.But I offer the following suggestions to attain the best performance:1) If you do not find you have adequate draft try expanding the burn cage as described.2) At any time you feel it is not burning to its optimum level begin by checking the ash tray then shake the burn tubes to dislodge any accumulated fly ash. (Anyone familiar with a coal furnace as I am having grown up with such can relate.) Fly ash tends to clump especially at the rear of the secondary burn plate and somewhat in the burn cage constricting draft.3) Should this still fail to bring it up to speed take a long object (I had an old automobile antenna I use.) and remove the Air Cover on the front of the primary burn tube sliding it through the spaces in the burn cage. This has worked like a charm for me thus far.I intend to follow these steps at least morning and evening as I feel it will prevent fly ash build up.*Lastly and importantly in case anyone finds the same question, there is a part (stainless steel plate) I simply could not figure out what it was or where it went. Contacting Tech Support is simple for the most part especially as they have text support and respond almost instantaneously. I found the part is listed as the Pellet Slide (Pgs 18-19) and drops into the feed opening of the pellet hopper. Also, it is Step 4 under Main Body Assembly though could be better described.I hope this provides assistance to anyone who is interested or has already purchased this unit. Also, there are numerous YouTube videos I suggest you view if possible. One is very negative though I cannot agree with their assessment.Addendum: Since writing this I have discovered a couple more nuances. I mention using an old auto antenna which works for opening the burn basket, but I made a tool using 3/8"" steel rod bent at 90 degrees with approximately 1 1/2"" extended. This allows me to probe the cage top and bottom and dislodge any buildup from fly ash. Though you can fill with 60# of pellets the chute just isn't efficient causing the pellets (sometimes) to burn back when unattended (overnight). I intend to make an auxiliary add-on chute adding capacity."
R1KMM3UA6UOOFO,"It was for a gift, easy to assemble"
RZPSTH4SMP6LJ,It was not very big. It rusts even after seasoning.
R3KI7YQ99BUG2Z,Last one was good for several years. This is a replacement
R18RWDQH8CJ6WO,junk.will not last.2 months of use and it falls apart.
RYLVMNK790HQ9,Good product
R1Z6O7BO9IGJZZ,"It's affordable and fills the need for a cheap heater in garage,but not very well made. One of the door hinges cracked when I hit it trying to seat the hinge pin and needed to be welded back together,probably junk cast iron. Feet didn't fit by barrel very well but mounting screws were long enough,might be due to design to work with multiple barrels."
RWBWZATFWS3NN,great item allows Our home to be warm on freezing nights
R179ZVC6POXIWD,"Great ready- to- go product to increase efficiency of a cheap barrel stove for garage,but not very well designed. The legs don't fit contour of barrel very well, and top barrel rocks a little due to small contact area. This may be deliberate to fit multiple barrel sizes.With some grinding it would probably fit against my 55 gallon barrel better."
RYA9P8AGIZ2KQ,"Great replacement for worn out or broken grates, exact fit."
R8FRJOOERHLH8,Great replacement product. Works perfectly.
RPA3WPLAK48EQ,That they came fast used for small fire place.
R1QZQ2O83ZQN09,It has a filter install and the chimney flue riveted in a almost closed position so it smokes uo the room and cant draw properly. removed the filter medium and freed up the flue by removing the rivets now it works ok.
RFBD4AV5MQ9QJ,"Cutting up the empty drum is hardest part and take your time. Do be precise with pre-drill of corner holes, lock it down and then drill the rest. Take damper apart to drill holes. The supplied nuts and bolts should be supplemented with lock washers at the minimum. If you are keeping it for years, get some stainless nuts, bolts, lock washers instead cuz when the drum burns out, it will be easier to deconstruct. Rather crude air input grate. Does the job for shop, garage etc."
R2E2MYO6I0TZG6,They work good.
R2AWO75399ZHSS,My husband says this product is fine.We'll see how they do when actually installed.
R372K4K6563EMV,"I'm in Central Ct and have one of the original smaller models of the stove and it is my sole heat source for mu 1000 sq ft home.I had a top of the line electric pellet stove previously, and compared to the electric, this stove id fantastic.I put more time into cleaning and maintenance in a couple years compared to this stove.People should know that the best pellets to burn in this stove are soft wood pellets.I've tried all variations, but the soft wood pellets burn clean, leave no residue, and produce the best amount of heat.I am just ordering my first replacement burn basket after almost 7 years of heating my home.I clean the stove's lower burn tube once every week or two (takes two minutes), otherwise I take the stove out each summer and blow any residual ash out with my shop vac.Burn softwood pellets!"
R253GG1S898LA6,exact replacement
R1DP37VOT7YM09,Excellent product and service
R3P0Y44TJRKH8Y,"Great, sturdy door"
R3E04ZY3OYQ8QQ,Great product
R2ARVB0J2WLD2C,"Bought these fire bricks to put in a hot blast furnace to replace the 5 year old ones that were starting to crack.Ordered these bricks they came all in one piece thought they would work great. They fit in the furnace nicely, unfortunately after one week of being in the furnace all the bricks have melted and about half of them have cracked. Not good for high temperature applications."
RIDCR93LBJED3,Open the amazon box and the box holding the stuff was busted open the leg was broken and the damper spring broke
RU18U9C8AJ6DM,The product was smaller than I thought but it does what I wanted it to do.
R30LVDHV8ZUWIP,easy to install and have not had a problem with it.
R3271JH39XOKWR,"The only problem I had was with the bolts and what you have to do is snug them down but don't over tighten, they will strip.Did have extra bolts"
R1ZHOGIVL8I0ET,Fit perfect works well
R1IQOM5LWJUB0E,Works as it should. I'm sure it will warp just like the original one did and will have to buy another one in a few years.
R1MIILVZG6YWN4,We used this to make a barrel stove in our new workshop.It's perfect for what we need this winter.
R3NSWO8QVK1B2O,Product was sent with wrong hardware and was built in a manner that even if correct hardware was include one leg would still be unable to be installed
R10SV712UFUH63,Puts out a noticable amount of heat. Bypassed the thermostat like others to get a little extra heat.Was pleasantly surprised that it worked so good at giving otherwise lost heat.
R2OYGD0MHKKR5B,Should have legs in middle also heat bent it.Used in wood stove
R2I4SES79HW6JJ,Replaced burnt out original
R10NP4U8J6MY85,Reasonable price fast ship
R1X5ZK4EL30Y15,This is a oem part and fits just as it should
R2H1OSJAG7MP4L,Like nice product
R1DI32C0L53CPX,"Was shipped on time and in good shape.First impression is its built kind of cheap. Fit and finish could be better. Needed to take a file to a couple welds for secondary burn plate to go in fully.Set it up in my garage. Concrete floor. Hooked up the flue to a 6"" dual wall flue going thru my wall. Bought some hardwood blend pellets at my local Ace Hardware and fired it up.Paint smoke was strong for an hour or so, but I just burnt it off with my garage door open. No big deal.Ran it full open(closed with this stove) and it ran straight to 800+ degrees. I opened the draft holes(which disrupts air flow). That was 3 days ago. I haven't shut it down yet. It holds 500-600 degrees, dropping down to about 400 near the end of a 12 hour cycle.I kind of just shake the primary, clean off the secondary, empty the ashesand fill the hopper every 12 hours or so. Its burning about 30# of pellets every 12 hours. I'm ok with that,but I think I can tinker with it and get that lowered some, either by closing the basket a little or maybe by adding a damper on the intake to be able to reduce air flow some.Bottom line, I absolutely love the design of this thing. Radiates alot of heat. Simple.I've burnt wood most of my life, so this pellet stove, that burns like a wood stove is right up my alley.I haven't tried to clean it yet. I do open it up wide open when I'm tinkering with it, so we'll see how that goes.I highly recommend this stove if you have a chimney with a good draft and some wood burning experience.I'm keeping a 24x40 building with 10' ceilings kinda insulated at 75 degrees for about 30 min of my time and like 4 bucks a day as it set up now. I'll have one put in the basement of my house this summer."
R19BEXDHR21MIF,Installed it this morning and do issues!!!
R31XH1K9O3FC98,installed it this morning and no issues....
R1X9Q4456CFMYL,I had these sent to me overseas - they arrived unbroken (contrary to what others have written) - very well packed (as others have said) - I’m very happy
R3OJBY6X799H8S,"Absolute trash! Came dented, and looked used. We had to dismantle and reassemble the product just to get it in working condition. Would NOT recommend."
R29R4Y7T89MX68,Easy to build
R3AEW4LQNXUIAR,"As I believe others have mentioned too in reviews, these don’t even come close to fitting the radius of my 55 gallon barrels! I’m installing my barrels on top of a regular woodstove, so the barrels themselves will just be a part of my chimney to my woodstove to work as a heat exchanger. Since my woodstove is double wall I was able to drill holes on each side and tap the holes to anchor these brackets on the side of my stove. The barrel sits on top of the brackets somewhat alright. But the way the brackets are drilled for screws there’s absolutely no way to screw the brackets to the barrels at all! I’m not sure if I’m going to have to figure out a way to anchor the barrels to these brackets yet or if the barrels will just stay sitting on the brackets on their own using gravity to hold them in place?Maybe find a high heat adhesive to glue brackets to the barrels may be my best bet? But again since the brackets don’t fit the radius of the barrels it not going to have much surface to surface to glue them in place! Obviously I haven’t got these installed completely yet, but I’m expecting some Mickey Mouse tactics to make this a safe secure installation. Personally, I would never recommend these brackets to anyone the way their design at this point! The cast iron woodstove collars for the pipe actually fits the radius of the barrels very well though!It’s a sad shame the manufacturer didn’t put more effort into these brackets to fit the radius of the barrels as they did these pipe collars. If they had these be 5 star woodstove barrels system if they figured out a better anchoring holes to screw brackets to the barrels!"
R2NVZQUJFV1T9W,Worked like a champ easy to bolt in place.
R12Q3327AKCVDO,"Box it came in was tore up real bad, so I was nervous about that, but the stove is very sturdy, and beautiful"
R2RMZAWEE5VT7L,Excellent quality
R2WOCJOKEX1M2T,Nice
R3SU0U0BJ69V5X,Best stove for your money I replaced a homemade unit with this one extremely happy
R2VTJSZF7G2OHX,Durable and Decorative wish it held more water
R2YZTJFL2W7QPB,Rust is very fast Really not meant to be holding water
R2H1EQLNZBUKWY,"This product only lasted one season, and it was only used maybe 12 to 15 times(weekends in small cabin) very disappointed that it broke in half after a few uses."
R3V0XVYTUAJB4P,"Broke in half when I put it in, which is why I wanted it replaced"
RTWIVW2WKK10H,Easy install but craftsmanship was weak. Like everything from China. Door was warped and doesn’t make a good seal but it isn’t air tight.It’s only for burning outside.
R1WQVJ3DN06KJM,The firebricks came very well packaged. We had to cut 2 of them for our wood stove. They cut easily with our wet saw. They seem to be good replacements for the old broken bricks. We will buy again when needed.
R99IYQO4BDUQF,Solid cast iron. Very cute. Holds about a quart of water . Sits on top of my wood burning stove. Humidifies the air enough to relieve nasal dryness.
R3O4O3T5Q0VD80,Had to replace both grates on my 1994 hot blast wood stove. Dirty job but they fit. Look like original.Cheaper thru Amazon than US stove. Still seems pricey for cast iron. So far so good.
R2CH35EKGICTPE,"MADE IN CHINAThe United States Stove located in South Pittsburg, Tennessee sells stoves that are made in China.I dislike that a properly installed thermostat will not shut off the pellet feedon the 5500M- only slows the feed.You have to physically press the off button which by the way is located in the left lower corner.Very difficult to see & reach it.I recommend you buy American Made!Also their isn't a remote control available for the 5500M.My contractor installed it before I moved in.Now I'm stuck with it."
R1ZRMHCEH3SGNS,Fire bricks for the fire pit. Makes cleaning the ash easier.
RK4S00V985MLL,if you move them much after high heat they will break in half sometimes. work great though as long as you dont move them to much and your not rough on them
R1YPIL0MB2CVSC,"Good quality,heavy built , easy install."
R1IKMY2ZCU7PFU,I just ordered this product and needless to say what I received does not match what is pictured. The one pictured is exactly what my stove has now. I don't know if what I received is the correct one or not. The packaging says it's 80314 put numbers on device do not reflect that nor does it look like device that is pictured. See pictures. Nowhere on device does it state it's F120-30F. Does anyone know if this is the correct one? I'm not sure where to post questions at.
R3D7FC5PIZ9K5D,Fits perfectly
R49L7RNPH8C7G,"after cutting the holes with a sawsall i thing a jigsaw with a good metal blade will work better. also i could not find a 6"" double wall pipe where i was in mexico so i had to have one made."
R2G2LK0RA68HKJ,This stove kit works very well and the price was right. The only problem was the draft holes were to small but it's made in China so i didn't expect much. I used my rotary tool and cured the problem and now it works fine
R2LPFVZ2Y7E3T9,My wife loves it! It's a little smaller thank I expected. We use it for the top of our wood stove.
R28HVCKHLIOW25,Hooked right up! Received early! Perfect fit
RCEFPNJOABOJ3,For heat for my pellet stove and was perfectfit for my stove
R2JGJ3LGVWCNJW,"Took about 4hrs to build and install the chimney.So happy with the heat in my shop now! Great product, stove works great!"

RI2F5TO14ZQ54,It’s a great wood stove
RYP755M5MRFUR,Works like original
RAKSKC9NPPLYB,Worked great.
RO9FVLC67IRDQ,"Very satisfied with this kit. Easy enough to install. Gets hot quick! Orient the large bunghole on the bottom, below the door so you can use it for extra ventilation to help get fire rolling. Once you have a good bed of coals, you can close it and it becomes more efficient."
R1ZRVS5GX6SRF6,Perfect fit
R1DPY76KIONGD9,"hard to find furnace part, but when found on Amazon was the perfect replacement part."
RU1CE3IE6GHKG,Great kit well worth the price..Fairly easy to assemble.
RJW53V0LVSNAR,Just what I needed
R2D7P81ZZ2X410,I bought these to use on a Chiminea and they work very well along with some pumice chips. Great product and saved alot of time on installing everything.
R1V0O6VJOZLC3W,Solid
R22ERG68J4RC0W,Smoke leaks out like a mess thru the door
RKSR8SU7K3208,"Made of iron, but lacks almost all detail."
R2KA55758U29L8,We have an older wood stove which needed new retainers and these are perfect and along with some new fire bricks updated the inside of the stove perfectly
R2R6F4NLY449F8,Defective straight out of box ordered another one it was defective straight out of the box will not buy no more of these absolute junk
RIZ2NP7GULR1P,It’s getting more and more rusty. Idk if others more expensive ones have a coating of some kind but my kettle doesn’t rust like this.
R2I7COBWNG0ZRW,I have purchased the blower for my pellet stove I've been using it for 2 months with no problem
R38FG3B7Z0IN1O,"Yeah, it’s small...read the dimensions in the description, but it’s the perfect size for heating confined areas. The flat top allows you to heat water for coffee and cook simple meals. Draws good and does not smoke."
RO4LTUEHBBIZ,Works like a champ in my shop
R4P6QLU4L51TA,I have been using it for a few months now and it is working great.It is pretty heavy duty cast and I think it will last quite some time.I would recommend buying it if you are looking for a decorative humidifier.
RYOM77GKQ1JK7,"Excellent!! Fit really nice, heavy duty , latched well. Would recommend."
R2L6V9PRCDNFX,Indestructible packaging
RB5H84A4ZD2TM,Perfect fit
R1TOQXOT3FSIPM,Perfect fit
R1BTTKONIGRGZZ,Worked as it is suppose to for our outdoor diy pool heater.
R2D6Y5MUSZT6JY,Doesn’t hold up to higher heat for long but still worth buying for the garage.
R2YWF8N4HV626M,Great product
R227L9NXIHXD5L,Easy to install and works as it should.
R168ZX805LYQ9V,"I like the even heat in all directions. Takes a little time to get it going, but once it does I enjoy the heat.Using it in my carport, outside, and works great."
R3ARVH70PXOQ18,Great for the price! Just needs sealed
R21KAZ62GACW9Q,"Seemed like a perfectly good unit, unfortunately ordered the wrong size.But in both shipping and quality it appeared top quality."
R22W6TW36G7OAI,Good use for bottom of fire pit

RFJZJD685ZHRW,it works
R2IUP716FKI0O0,this products exhibited rust after putting water in it
RPJKPZHVQCX56,Looks really nice!!
R2Z6L0RG8GRV1D,Works great
R7LIEVH7UBHO9,Works good so far the one that came on our hot blasts 1440 ussc only lasted a year which was disappointing I hope this one last longer
R1TR0VP6KKO3EK,Worked as intended
R2N8191DZRFT0S,It works great.
R9XYFQFOZ0FUH,The door and stove pipe flange are nice. The bolts that are provided are junk and strip extremely easily. The leg castings don't fit very well and are really weak. Angles on the legs are not correct. I used the legs but they cracked already and I will end up replacing them. They paint doesn't stand high temperature very well.
R3TIHWDNOB0NP6,The bolts provided with the kit are very poor quality and strip before they get very tight. The stand off castings are really poor quality and don't fit the shape of the barrel. Where castings should be round to fit the barrel shape they are flat instead. The stove pipe flanges are ok. They are the only part of this kit that are really usable. The paint doesn't stand up to high temperature very well. Overall the kit is barely usable.
R2GXRMIO5OYYD5,We use it with every fire (all winter long).Works great. Cute too.
R1GXH5KI5NOWS8,Used 60 days and it broke
R3H9A2H2WY9V4O,This was the exact replacement...
R3DNC413ASUSJM,it was used in my pellet stove it fit perfect
R2ZBD24Z9IKPOV,"Broke 1/2 of them within the first week. Bought some from tractor supply. They have been in over a month, getting used hard and have not broken. They fit fine and the look nice but I can’t say I would recommend them"
R188969CROCTF2,"Nice heavy duty setup, works fine and looks great."
R31S1PT5XHWTR5,Received 10/17/19. Installed 10/20/19. Starting using wood stove around 11/1/19. See picture from 1/6/20. I think this photo tells you all you need to know. In about 9 weeks of use this cast iron grate has collapsed in back and starting to collapse in the middle. Not worth the minimal effort of attaching its legs. Just don't buy.
RS9YXRYN6HUOT,"Fast delivery,not too hard to install, works like a dream"
R11R08Q3C8Z7K6,"Wood stove, worked great"
R1883MSSFDMC5E,This is a great looking pellet stove. I get compliments on it all the time. Most have never seen anything like it. It warms very nicely. A very low maintenance pellet stove.
R13NEA197FTYZO,"Very fun project. It was easy to put together (about a 2 hour job) and works well! The only downsides- my kit was missing the flue collar and I wish they’d provide some sort of jig to make sure the legs are centered and aligned. All in all, I’d order this again and make more!"
RGDWXTR2A137C,It gets very hot
R220TDKGOUMSJ,Two weeks after using the miracle heater it started making a loud noise when it runs.
R2EB73TV0J92QN,Sturdy product.
RGCV4KD8SCX27,Fit and works as stated. Replaced my one just fine.
R1GAIXIQASP5U6,"I ordered two of these, one was quality which I assume was an original manufacturer product, the other was a really poor quality and I had to do a lotof grinding and cutting to get it to fit. It looked crappy to begin with and I would have returned it but we are in the middle of winter and I needed heat. I hope it lasts."
RJZ6ASYHAGHCO,Worked as it should.
RL0GA9Y9Z7XC5,The best thing we ever bought
RTZ73VVCL2YJ1,I ordered the Drum Kit and the legs and door fit perfectly.Then I ordered the double drum adapter without reading the Reviews!What a mistake.The legs are angled incorrectly so that the drum doesn't rest properly on the lower drum.WTH?There is no quality control to fix this BS??
R2QCNZWI6FQ9KU,Perfect
RC90K0NPG4RKJ,Perfect fit for my add on wood/coal stove.
R2F1JL1DX4NCZ1,"I’ve had zero problems with the switch, works just as it should!"
R1BRJ77L2G6ZP6,The smoke barrels out of it from every seam of the body of the fireplace.I added so many corrective elements until I finally gave up and threw it away.It is a hazardous products and should be taken off the market.
R13Z4PL3TXBZLQ,A good heavy door just like the one I'm replacing.
R17RMR92H0CO87,"used in wood burnig stove, works well"
R1C90OMDX6UTJ8,"paid over $100 for this part and 1 year and 2 weeks later it stopped working.apparently there is nothing that can done after 6 months of purchase, so in my opinion it was notworth the money...Invest in a genuine part instead..."
RIFER007Y68NE,could not use it
R258KJAK42ORJZ,Good thing this is cast iron as the box was flimsy and torn up when it arrived. Item was not broken.
R1BEAHPI5ANRMW,"Fit right up like it should, put it on a us coal and wood stove"
R20CRM1IC1K08X,Works wonderful!
R3HNWJWX2GHPUK,Fit the woodstove works at perfect temperatures for best results. Recommended for woodstove
R2LJGUSF51DCAS,Works great!
R178JRXWDTZDOQ,Bought this to replace the old rusted stamped steel door that had seen better days. I had to tap it in a few places to get the door to close correctly. My wife saw the finished product set in the back of the fireplace. I said I what going to paint it the same color as the house. She said to leave it since it is case Iron and look nice just the way it is.
R1NUN9HKTAY1JV,Product was sturdy and good quality for the price. Have to wait and see how it fairs through winter use.
R14EYIKAJMMW5V,Same as original
R2WYM6LRFHTA84,Working well
R2QCN7W58DZ92A,"Needs wiring instructions, not direct replacement. Will update when I get it working."
R1GLLCABKRU65K,I like it
R31A3RUFDXM0A7,It works great and puts off lots of heat but it was time consuming and a bit hard to put together.
R3T0ZKAFLJUGGU,This is super cute but I thought it would be bigger. I have to fill it twice a day.
R8IX4A80SRBGU,"I received this as a gift 3 days ago and haven’t used it yet so I won’t comment on it’s practicality.Upon removing it from the box a couple things were obvious.There is NO porcelain coating.None, nada, zip.Why they use the term “porcelain” is a mystery.It was very well packaged but the dull black coating was already coming off all the edges, revealing the silver colored metal underneath.Some of those edges are already rusting. Not a great first impression.From what I’ve read cast iron itself is gray or silver and the black color is the layer of burnt on polymerized oil. If you see the silver color you’ve scrubbed off the seasoning and need to re-season it 3-5 times before using it.This steamer has clearly not been seasoned at all and I suspect the black stuff was just sprayed on.....and chipped/rubbed off being handled and packaged.Since it won’t be used for cooking I will take another users advice and use an industrial oil for seasoning.Vintage cast iron was seasoned a variety of different ways, with a variety of different products and techniques.Don’t confuse the cast iron used in this steamer with what your good quality cast iron skillet is made of.I assume once seasoned properly it will perform as expected and will require periodic re-seasoning.Just know what you’re getting for the price."
RRCX9ZMMMT3XB,"Isn't ceramic coated on inside i seasoned it twice, but it still rusted."
R4J7935UP4ZPC,well made product fit right
R2ENGY48ZGOKUO,No good. It’s not coated inside so each time the water boils it wipes out any seasoning from before. Eventually just rusts.
R1MUG1TXEQDXNL,I liked finished product. I dont know the difficulty.As I didn't put it together.
R2TUR5WFFWHWYG,Can't just assemble there's lots of extras to do!Need to make one fully built!Door was off doesn't seal properly
R2N8P5RL60ACSE,Better than I expected
R1WT1KKCJLU1M4,It was exactly what I needed!
R1Z1W5W5DPNYGK,", this product worked perfectly thank you very much will be ordering from you again if need be"
R39P8Z5I05IO9J,Bearings making a nose after 2 1/2 months. Not good.
R3NHIB0CGU62KA,Exactly the part I needed. Fits perfectly
RKF0L6HL1AGUM,Easy toput together and install great value for the price
R3C33ZPF2QN9NR,Nice house warming gift.
R274H984OVAOJG,"Product had to be taken apart and rebuilt. The motor spun the opposite direction.Once it was rebuilt, it works good."
R2H3OBVY1WFHZR,"We have a metal fire pit in the backyard that completely rusted out due to the ashes sitting in the bottom of the fire pit. We bought a new fire pit and completely sprayed it with high temp paint, covered the bottom with sand, and then used these fire bricks to put on top of the sand and line the bottom of the fire pit. Our current fire pit is holding up far better than the first and these extra steps of paint, sand, and these fire bricks are far cheaper than buying a new fire pit. Also heads up, we almost used regular bricks to line the bottom as we had some laying around the house, luckily we found out that regular bricks can explode when exposed to heat where as these bricks are made for high temps."
R11RVD1BG7L25B,It's working just fine
R2EAUE47R1IGB7,Great product
R2653QPUGT0S8,"Made a nice burn stove. Added kaowool and enclosed it with bricks to make a miraculous pool heater. If you want to heat up a patio or even use as a cooker, I added a flat top burner to it for cooking as well. Will upload video when completed editiing.Love this thing."
R3A06XVKHHDCE7,One piece was broken.
RTTH56CGRWY9B,"Like it, had to do a bit of improvisation to make it work, but most likely would have been the case with any door."
R1NEVPPC6PDXIW,fits right in to my wood stove
R3TQY1CJQH9R7K,Perfect fit like original.Has been holding up great.
R3PCP0ZKCMDRDP,"All these bricks broke after I fired my woodstove. I made sure when I installed them that they weren’t bound up or under stress. When I added wood i didn’t slam wood in there. They came packaged in foam, I’m thinking they know they’re a poor product. I don’t believe they are fire brick"
R2QFOYEX5MMK69,"Works perfectly....got a barrel with a lid for 30$ ....puts out a ton of heat, I side my screened in porch in winter. It’s about 16x16....was 30 degrees out side and 68 on porch. Well worth the money. Recommend burning several fires outside first as the barrel paint need to burn off completely of it smells."
R5Z990E1P07M8,Works great. Easy to install. Only took about 15 minutes.Put out a lot of heat.
REOSUCQDHAEKT,Was as the original one and worked great so far
R1WE2VVUS05RHB,"Good product,hardest part was putting on the legs but other than that easy to install."
R3JP5BO4Q18IB1,Great heavy duty damper

R2O9CPZ23D0O3L,"Setup was easy, no damage on shipping, starting her up with a map gas torch takes less than three minutes. Easily heats our 1700 square ft home. The issues...the three inch exhaust pipe is NOT standard three inch pellet stove pipe. I had to take a belt sander and sand down the pipe neck to get the pipe on. Daily the pellets will start to burn up the filler neck and the small pellet box fills with smoke, a little percussion maintenance with a rubber mallet allows the stuck pellets to fall. This is an issue as the only ""off"" button is to close the hopper and let it burn our. I have an immediate 90deg elbow into 3ft of horizontal 6 inch pipe then into a 24ft of lined chimney with no draft issue. With the baffle/dampner wide open I am running 500-600deg at the stack and 700 plus with it closed. Lastly, I'm going thru 40lb of pellets in ""low"" , nowhere close to the 30+ that is advertised. I got a deal at $1000 thru Amazon Prime and would buy it again but I would not give $1,600-$2,400 that I've seen them advertised for."
R1PXHYTGU56TXF,Nice product
R1AH6XJBLQI0R8,"I purchased this item 8 months ago and did not even get a full season's worth out of it.Purchased in April and it is mid December so had only truly 3-4 months use.Living in W. Michigan I need my pellet stove to work.I recommend buying parts from a actual US Stove distributor.I may be a bit more, but you get quality solid parts.The most expensive part is the part you have to buy twice.:-("
R2CEODRBPC00C,"Fit great, works great. Its perfect!"
RWSIT81D9KOQP,"This thing kicks butt. Works great, uses alot of pellets even on low. A bag of pellets a day. Really kicks heat out ! 91° on the lowest setting. Definitely worth the price"
RJS8BNHELP331,"WE have not installed the grate yet, appears to be same as an original. No problem with this seller."
R2PCYECMI8ZHB1,"shipped as promised , direct fit to my us stoves brand pellet stovevery quiet .would be nice if i could purchase just the electric motor , seems a bit wasteful to replace the housing"
R1HLLMNCDHLEM0,"Love it. Used a jigsaw to cut openings for front hatch and upper flue, after drilling pilot holes. Picked up 55 gallon drum to convert into inexpensive wood stove for the patio - for ambiance, and to burn pine boughs and overgrowth in yard."
R1O45NFQNIME1J,Love the product
R353TIZ4C9J4EG,"I just got this installed and it’s working great. The screw on the latch was broken, the box it comes in was in rough shape (shipping box was fine and screws were all over the box when I got it. I think it should have come with a template to help cut out the holes, but not to hard to figure out. My only real problem with the kit is the poor quality screws that striped out.That being said I cut out the holes with a cutting torch, drilled the holes for the screws and got it all put together and working and it seems to be working great.something I found out the hard way is when you find a barrel make sure it’s not the one with the removable lid that has the rubber on the lid... mine is smoking the off, it’s heavy duty so I don’t know how long it will take to burn off. I’m thinking of grinding it off and adding one of those fire ropes. Make sure you take it out side and burn it hot to burn off all the paint. After that I added fire bricks to the bottom to help save the bottom of the barrel. I have it hooked to a through the roof chimney in my garage and I’m really happy with the way it drafts. If you found this helpful please hit the helpful button. Thanks."
R5JJQKKXYZ31O,Worked perfectly
R26KIXEF1F7YG3,"Ive owned this stove since 2008 and although I have nothing to compare it to, overall Ive been very satisfied.Not sure if the new ones have an electronic ignition, but mine doesnt, so I need to start it with a propane torch.No big deal.Im in Northern Maine where we get a solid 4-6 weeks of negative temps, I live in a 1917ish American Foursquare thats 2 full floors, a basement and full stand up attic thats been renovated with new insulation, windows, doors, etc.House is roughly 1,955 sq.ft. of living space not counting the basement or attic.In the middle of January when its -10 overnight, I run the stove on 6 or 7 (has 9 power settings) and it keeps the living room (where the stoves located) 75, keeps the back bathrooom (go from the living room through the diningroom or kitchen, through the mudroom, around and through the door into the bathroom) 65.Upstairs bedrooms stay between 68 and 64 (back room is cooler) and the attic stay 60ish.Has many pre-set heat settings AND you can tweak them yourself in manual.I go through about 8 or 9 bags a week during the REALLY cold season, and I have to shut it off Sundays, clean the burn pot and inside of the stove (about a 30 minute job) and start it back up.It is on the louder side but I removed the air vents and that cut down on the whistling.Every summer I open it up and clean the room fan, exhaust fan and auger motor well.We ran it for about 3 years without doing that, then the room fan starting making a noise from the buildup of dust on it, so we know better now.I picked up this stove on sale for $1500 when heating oil prices went from $1 a gallon to $3 and Ive saved myself a TON of money.I burn 3 tons of pellets a year on average (I once burned 3 1/2 and once or twice 2 1/2).Love the woodstove look without the hassle of hauling wood.My cats jump up on it and sleep on it all the time, although the front of the stove WILL burn you, so if you have little ones youll want a gate around it.All in all couldnt be happier."

R1LWR0JD0GSKLN,"Very easy to assemble, with the proper tools was able to assemble in under an hour with my 11 year old grandson."
R29X86GRRS7SP6,The parts are adequate.It will work but may take a little ingenuity on your part.Once assembled it works great.We have it in our metal building shop.
R2JRAC1NRNN6J9,We have had our wood stove for 5 years. We installed the heat exchanger this year and have finally been able to heat all the rooms in our house.It works like a charm! And the price can't be beat.
RHB3K18X5TGZG,Not real sturdy construction. Crack easily.
R2SR4LQI0BVXSD,This stove works good and it saves me wood too. I use half the wood I used in my old stove and it is keeping the house toasty warm.
R1XXZMIRMQOVE8,"Can’t beat the value and quality. Stove is working great out in my garage and was quick to install pieces onto barrel. Exceeded my expectations, especially at the price point."
R1233HA82ZFCEQ,Fast shipping
R2O0BL5U3Z81AU,"Had to do without or Breckwell 5500 pellet stove for a couple of days as the blower froze and gave out.Was afraid of finding a blower replacement.Found this one, husband got it installed easily (cleaned the stove from top to bottom) and we were off and back up running.The bonus was that the fan is now quieter than the original one."
R28E47Z6NRCZT,Packaged well no broken bricks
R11B02ERTQ631I,This will be used to heat the cabin. I haven't installed the fire place as of right now. It was at a really good price to pass up.
R29EPJR25K4BEF,Works as it should
R3OOZ9YFLH2I1P,"Good value for the money, casting of product is clean"
R33I9HDGCYK2EY,Thought it was neat. Looks cool on my wood stove.
RX0M2WW4ZDH6J,So far so good runs quiet!!
R27YA0TLXZG3YW,"The factory agitator had warped through the years and one of the ""teeth"" was knocked off by a clinker.The welds on this one are way heavier and the fact that it is stainless steel make it much stronger."
R1C9U1S9D7Q2CL,"These are perfect reflecting ceramic firebricks for a wood burning stove. I replaced my OEM firebricks and my stove has never run more efficiently.These are NOT the same as high density, insulating firebrick used for insulating only. These are low density (i.e. ""very light"") by design and meant for stove/fireplace linings to increase efficiency of the fire.Anyone giving them low ratings after not using for intended purposes is foolish."
RST2ARC3O69JN,works great. I would recommend using a barrel with a removable lid to make assembly and cleaning easier. heats my small shop just fine.
R1SVKYRP8YRHSC,It was a lot smaller than it looks in picture but very cute.
R2AG7JRS8SPMVY,"Small, does not steam fast, rusts on inside"
R1G28LX8RVNHRL,"So I paid for one new 8031 thermo disc. Instead I received a bag of 5 used 8031 thermodiscs. The package, shown in the picture, doesn't indicate new or used.Amazon, you can do better than this."
R35H1GCNEUP9EC,Perfect fit
RF2RS6FG85EQ2,Oven in camper
R1Y2ETULJDOXTW,Love it..our space it much warmer
R3KSVHV0BTHLO2,If I could give this stove zero stars I would it should be fit for a Barbie play house in your back yard and that is all. All my friends laughed when they saw it.
R3FDHX399HD8CE,"This Grate fit perfectly in My Wood and Coal Stove just like factory Grate ,looks to be of top quality material"
R10F18OB96PH2T,Used an old 55 gallon drum to heat up a 40 ft container. Burning hardwood in and vented out the side.the Cutting hole in the container wall is the hardest part. This is the warmest it's ever Been and the moisture on the wall and ceiling dried up completely. I use this temporally while we build a house on the land. This worked great.
R31PKVGI9YKEVX,They say it is not suppose to rust DO NOT BELIEVE THEM the very first time I used it it rusted all inside.
R12KD35BEGKIJN,Perfect fit for my stove. Easy to install.
R18WKJ5034J018,Perfect fit for my wood furnace. Just as good as the original grate. Very satisfied
R2XI2OPBTDV0SK,Perfect replacement. It holds the fire in not much more to say.
R1GCWDS79VQIEK,Easy to install been going for at least five years
R2D2D1L2VPJ9CM,Description is what product is
R1HYU0O7LQH88I,"I bought this heat reclaimer for my garage.I'm not out there everyday, so I couldn't justify buying the Magic Heater for $200.I bought the Miracle Heater instead, and I've been disappointed.I didn't think it would be such cheap product that I have to unplug it because of the rattling.Again, you get what you pay for."
R1S6AEIJ2ISV16,"Mine warped two inches upward in the middle after only a few months use. It broke in two when I attempted to press it back out (didn't think it would work, but loss of that 2"" in my small long stove was a problem). On the plus side, due to the shape of my stove, two broken pieces turned sideways work almost as well as when the grate was new..."
R13RRHVXI85H6G,I bought the stove from Tractor Supply. I'm a 40 plus years woodstove user. This is the worst design ever.People aren't joking about the smoking issue. I too took the stove apart in an attempt to understand what the problem was. The problem is just a very poor design. My stove did not come with a fiberglass blanket but it did have the metal plate with a tiny little space left for smoke to exit from. Smoke only exits from the open door...period. I removed the plate which btw also helps prevent fire from going directly up the chimney pipe....and within minutes had a raging chimney fire. Do NOT BUY THIS STOVE! CHEAP AND MADE IN CHINA!!!!!
R1TNLZC8Q8ZT4Z,Factory replacement
RBERIXO8TRMDF,What to say about a shaker grate frame? Good construction and fit correctly.Happy with product.
R1EVA8BUG6FZH9,Well made and fit stove like a glove.

R16JI1PQLYGHY8,"works great , heats better than my old one, great buy for the money and saves me money heating my house and I cook breakfast with it."
R3U08BLSK80Z1N,Exactly what was needed to replace old warped grates
R1YFPOT1G9CTC4,Works great!
R1WG4XPZQUDQUZ,"I have had this stove stores for a few months since purchase. It has been well kept and held in its original packaging. Serran wrapped and still on the wood pallet it had been shipped on. As the it is getting colder know, and waiting to get some remaking things in place for the stove. I finally in packaged it yesterday. Hoping this would be an easy deal hooking up. My thought was the hardest part would be the chimney side of the installation. Upon opening the stove and revealing it for the first time. I noticed something didn’t seem right. All the parts seem to be there, but the hardware wasn’t anything close to what was needed to put the stove together. As I read through the instruction I also noticed the stove. The stove according to the drawing should’ve already had the front and back stove pieces assembled prior to it being shipped. I figured this had not been done also for I noticed. I noticed the four main threaded rodpieces. The rod pieces siton the outside four corners that sandwich the top/bottom pieces together and hold everything in. Two of the four rod pieces are to short and will not reach the holes. Making it impossible to thread the bolt onto. This explaining why the front and back pieces to the stove were never in place. I verified this by pulling all four rods out and sizing them side to side. The were significantly shorter by 1/8 in. or more.This is the bases for assembly but seems the pre-assembly wasn’t done right because of faulty parts. Also somehow one door hung pin was missing also. I’m very disappointed for I plan on using this for heat throughout the winter, but creates another set back. I took my time shopping around prior and this one seemed mostly along the lines of what I needed and was looking for. I just wished I had opened it up sooner. This is the downside to online orders. You never know what the product actually is like until you see it first hand. I extremely regret this purchase and now am wishing I’d just gone direct. Shipping this thing back is going to be hard enough and chances are I will only get a percentage on my return. Think twice before you buy this stove."
R2W02SB78LNANS,"We love it, puts off a lot of heat for my 140 ft by 40 ft shop, we used the double barrel kit. lined the bottom with fire brick and put metal grates on top of that for air flow and ashes to fall through"
R3MAG0YVYCXTJ7,One of the worst products I have ever purchased in my life. Legs did not fit barrel at all!
RYQMP9S98PB76,Smaller than I thought but serves the purpose
R1AUOH8RFPWBH8,Not for heat. If so needs modifications.I made major modifications and ok; however typical buyer will not cut and weldTo get performance as stated. Patent pending on paper work understood. Perfect for California rules
R2TLWMR0AH7XTA,Ok
R1RTSUZWDPKR4N,Works like a charm!!!
R3UNFWOWL36QZ8,"Fan bolts right on, best price I found on Amazon. OEM part."
R2Q7T5098D814X,Works great

RE4GYLBAZMAN9,Wood stove
RR82ENL0D8TUB,It was the the one I needed
R1JF47EDLC76CH,"I live off-grid and wanted this stove since it doesn't require electricity. It doesn't work properly. I wake up to a cold house, with the thermometer reading 100 on the stove. It should maintain 300 to 400 with my dry pellets. It also builds up creosote in the chamber that drops pellets making it nearly impossible to pull out the tube with the burn basket. (look closely at the pic, one of the solder joints was cracked on arrival too ). Ash builds up in the basket and I have to use a butter knife to poke at it every 2 hours or it will stop burning. I wanted this stove to work...I threw $1500 down the drain. I am very disappointed. I hope the US STove company will replace it with another model."
R34S7RM2FTWUTN,Cute
R7XV1FT65104P,No rack or ash catcher.
R13FW3ULNPGDKZ,Puts out a lot of heat
R1S3U5EZJLM4C8,Hard to put togeter
RPK4ZLLVZTR9W,"Great blower motor. Fit perfectly,works great.2 years later and still working 100%"
R1KAUOMK06AG7Y,Phillips head bolts suck
R1FO5O1V6KELTN,I love this stove. It heats like a woodburner. I have this installed in an uninsulated basement and given 2-3 hours I can have the temp to 76-80 degrees. I also have an electric pellet stove but that will only maintain a high of 68 degrees in my basement. This stove is not for everyone as it does require that you need to tend to it every so often. It’s not like an electric pellet stove where you set and just walk away. It’s also harder to clean than an electric pellet stove. I did find that if you buy a leaf blower you can blow the ash right out of your pipe by putting the end into the main burn basket area once cooled down. It works fantastic. My wife loves the warmth that this stove gives off. I have 14’ of rise in my pipe and this will maintain a temp of 600+ for about 2-4hrs before it starts to drop due to ash buildup inside. I clean it everyday to maintain high temps and good heat distribution. I will say though that it definitely burns more pellets than advertised. I would say two bags a day if ran on high continuously
R3C6U99LLCCOVP,"Well....It will do what it is designed to do. The castings are not the best fit. I was going to install mine on two 55 gallon steel drums. Since my build is going to be a BBQ smoker, these castings (while they would do the job) wouldn't look so well when finished. They just didn't the barrel like they should have."
R2PQV0MSVP603G,Not big enough for average wood stove
R21HOAQGBSEBLG,Fit perfect in our wood burner
R989NUGOO470R,"Good product, prompt delivery!"
R379KSBQ1ARDKN,Product was broken.
R39FGLLZ2OGX4I,"Was exactly what i was looking for and needed to fit my stove. Was hesitant at first due to the sizing confusion, though it fit perfect for my Wonderluxe B2350 model."
R2FPD7E8GGKCP5,This doesn't appear to be firebrick at all.This is more like cinderblock- very porous and light weight.My stove got hit with lightning and the original firebricks on the back cracked; I should have left them in the stove.They would absolutely have served Better than these.
RB3Y3TYP4HKM5,"Replaced all the firebrick in a Bodega Bay after more than a decade of use.Used a diamond drill for the two bricks over the air inlets, used a tile saw for the bricks that needed to be cut down to fit.Much less than a complete set from manufacturer to replace the old fire bricks.The uncut ones were correctly sized for replacement, all the rest that needed to be altered cut very well and fit right into the stove.Will purchase again to replace broken ones or when they wear out in a decade."
R3RLD3RGPYGUV7,this handle was an exact fit for the one that broke on my stove. I wished that it would have had the installation hardware with it since mine was damaged on my old handle and could not be reused.
R12UPV5AIYDW5Q,Love it. Fit perfect
R2C3BMZ833IZ6M,It fited my fireplace works great
R357LU6GV7T5RE,Smaller than my old one & NO HOLE FOR WATER. Very in convenient when the stove is extremely HOT.Now I’ve included a picture.Rusting inside. Big mess. NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!!
R3N2GX4XJ7S64S,Great size and works great distributing moisture into the air
R2GENWSI2S4EYJ,I have been heating with pellet stoves since 1996. I love this stove. Easy set up. It heats my New England home really well. There is a learning curve - mostly getting to know your stove and keeping it clean. I love it's simple uncomplicated design a lot. Not much can go wrong. Personally I find it easier to clean than other electric pellet stoves. I have the stove vented directly up through the ceiling. Drafts well. Nice and quiet. I have been using it for several months as my major source of heat. Fantastic stove.
R3S2ZSH7W6F46W,Perfect in my garage. Delivery people left it at the wrong house.
R30PDKN2U03CRZ,Great
R1FZ3H0NKSUQU,"A cute piece, but way to small to be at all useful.My fault, should have read the description better."
RB654R2UPPD32,"works great,if you could come up with a silent blower it would be grrreat!!!"
R29XOTCF9I514Q,"I've bought two, so I know, it fit well in my stove, but falls apart.These work for a little while and then break.I'm looking for something different now."
R3HV778M7K1J3P,This blower works as good as the original blower did. Very quite so far.
R1LSCNRX8J5U5I,"It showed up broken in half.... they like, only bubble rapped one side of the brick."
RZJTXXYYTPII6,"We bought this stove to heat our bonus room, it literally blows us out of there! It heats over half of a 2200 sq ft. Ranch on a slab! Yes it smoked on the first burn, not enough to be concerned about and yes it had a “burning plastic” smell on the first burn and at the beginning of the second burn. To date we’ve been burning in there everyday since we installed it a week and a half ago and it’s been great! It’s easily a 7 hour burn. We really love this little stove, the price was great and it was delivered in one piece within 2 days of order. We ordered the stove, then noticed the negative reviews, obviously we were anxious after reading them however this stove proved itself to us. I’d recommend this little stove to any consumer. We’ve truly had nothing but a great experience with this stove."
R3IY8L7RGDTCJ9,"Works great for what I needed it for. Got what I expected, awesome product"
R1GWRUICV1H07P,"This is my old grate with a picture of a piece of my new grate, old one was in all last season with no problems until last week, replaced it with a new one and a week later, snapped, the grate is still in as the fire is still burning, lucky I bought 2, well not really cause next week I'm going to have to replace it"
R3J6V285I1A0C1,I replaced the original grates in my furnace. Job was simple fit was great

R2DYLKAP4HDZPU,Amazingly powerful and bolted right up and wired in.
R35SAIA8BY9QEE,"Awesome product, came fast they gave me extra bolts, hooks up just as they say, and that baby throws off the heat, just as expected great product"
R3BDUE8SL5LV6R,easy to install
R1H5UGOMKHGPXL,This stove puts so much smoke in house we can not use it.We have tried all the recommendations we could find but nothing works!I do NOT Recommend this stove.
R3TOQNN04ECNFW,Arrived with a broken leg judging from reviews this is repetitive issue not only that but the legs are to tall for the connecting pipes. I ended up using the connecting pipes and welding my barrels together.
R2TN22FVNK7PXF,Fast shipping. The dog chewed the cord when we had the stove disconnected to clean.
R2JNUOFP5VPU8,Fit perfectly unit was well packaged and arrived quickly
R287COMQBFRFKD,Good stove but I had the same problem with theburn pot.. drilled the holes out to the next size up ..fixed the problem.
RG9RY7RPSXJ4T,"Fit inside my Traeger JR perfectly, helped stabilize temperatures and with heat dissipation."

RV8Y60IANBIU4,Worked good
R2I3DN25HIM8CT,Easy install. Used for work shop heat.
R1JJBF68NPADWN,"This stove is a rip-off! Unfortunately, I didn’t try to return it until four days past the return cut-off date. My cabin is under 400 sq. Ft. And it would not keep me warm at a night-time temperature of 30 degrees. Also, a 40 lb. bag of pellets lasted only 14 hours, not 36 as advertised. If you are living without reliable (24/7) electricity do not even think about this stove as an alternative!!!Back to wood on the Kaibab Plateau"
R1MI947PX0E688,easy peasy !
R29OBO9D97FDHT,"I wasn't expecting more that what I received.Got exactly what I was hoping to get. A nice way to keep warm outside without the hassle of smoke, once I added a 5' stack. If watching the fire is your thing, this isn't for you. If being able to feel the heat and not have smoke in your eyes, this might just be what you are looking for. Florida winters are't dangerously cold, but if it gets too cold I will just go inside!"
R185GN1EAGWGZ0,"Meh, small, box was a mess, and it just wasn’t worth the cost for what it was."
R25B0H0FSAZELH,"Works very well, am happy with my purchase."
RSTYKMRQKKE2D,Very sturdy and it looks great!
R35HCUXHQ1E86F,What i needed
R1OG96HIGR624W,Bought to replace blower on wood stove works better than the old one. Easy to order and always delivered ahead of scheduled time.
R1RHKS2IHZ31X1,Garage heater
R1C30XOYH3VECH,Fit perfectly on my US Stove 6039.My old blower was making noise for so long and was seizing up while running.Put this in and I sometimes forget it is running.Although it isn't completely silent it is much better then the one I had.Looks like they added a mini fan at the end of the motor to try to help keep it cooler which should help it last longer.Very easy installation.Works great so far.
R3Q21WFN3MT0YK,"fit perfect, great price, could not be happier"
R3OCD1O1C2Z9MT,Have been wanting one of these for years.First season but so far we love it
RQ60QHYALH0CV,"This door is heavy and very sturdy.The opening on my chimney was 8"" x 9 1/2"".The door flange is 7 5/8"" x 7 5/8"" so I used mortar to lock in the frame and added the door later.One advantage to using this door versus some others it that the pins on the hinge are straight so the door can easily be removed by simply opening and sliding it upwards.You can then mount just the frame (which extends about 1 1/8"" into the chimney on the sides and 7/8"" on the top and bottom).There are also 2 predrilled holes, one on each side of the mounting flange which gives you another mounting option.Once mortared in place, I let it set for a few days and then installed the door.As far as comments and questions about a latch, it does actually latch closed to the point that air would not blow it open.You actually have to lift the handle just a bit to ""disengage"" it and then open the door.But once closed, it is in fact latched closed."
R297SID7VF5NK6,works great
R2M8D40OVWB8P0,Like
R1EBM3XJTGFD4K,These melt and turn to glass in the forge. Had to recoat because the melted brick stuck to the coating and pulled it off. Don't buy. Missed the return window but would have returned.
R2BI1VVKHOIWUE,"When it worked it worked well. On two occasions the thermostat failed and the fan stopped working, the wiring melted and it is now useless."
RDZVCJZ9JKWIO,work well
R3Z36BM0PGDWG,Good quality for the price
R1B80MAT3S9X20,OEM fit and function
R2AIW7WV48PH71,"I was hesitant to buy these based on the reviews that said a lot of the bricks arrived broken, but I received all mine intact. I use them in my fireplace insert to make the firebox smaller as I get the same amount of heat from my blower whether the fire is big or a little smaller. Would buy again."
R3BOUSAS4MX4KF,"Worked fine, all parts were included."
R1VVNLFKTTHRWC,easy installation
RAMU3198XWICX,"I have had the stove for 9 years going on 10. Only issues I have had were igniter went out, I just use 90% isopropyl alcohol, and the wires pulled loose from the auger because they had them stretched too tight the wire tie. It does not like cheap softwood pellets. You do have to burn a good quality hardwood pellet and usually some adjustment needs made with different brands."
R1OFEXUUOUC4B0,Excellent replacement
R1MIH9LUH3WG4N,"Item arrived with box having holes, screws and nuts all loose within. Have 29 bolts, 24 nuts. Also missing flue collar"
R2PA70OAESX81T,Wood stove in basement. Seems to work really good
RR0M8A4PE8168,Very happy
RAKTBI6LCFKU0,"Very easy to install. Already have used it and works great. I'm running my fireplace and have heated my house up to 83 degrees. Will stay warm throughout the night, where I don't have to wake up freezing. I have not turned on my furnace. Tonight is going to be a good test since we are under a freeze warning, the other times when its been 50- 60 outside."
R1IBASTAOC1YWJ,"Good working unit, on off switch seems a little cheap but seems to be working fine"
RSVP6BXQUPSZ3,"I got this stove for $199 shipped a few years back. I kept the fiberglass insulation in it for a few years. I had to pull it out because it was getting clogged. The thing I recommend is hard dry wood split thinly and a good draft through your flue. You can take out the metal strip on the top or drill holes into it like I did to increase the draught.I use it in 1 room of an insulated 3-car garage and it gets hot. I've had it up to 8-900 degrees. The hotter the safer it is and better the draw and the cleaner it burns. I also have an attic fan through the wall to heat the rest of the garage after the room gets to 74 degrees. But you must return the volume of air taken out by the fan with the use of a large vent or the fan will give you negative pressure and suck all the smoke from the chimney into your room.Not great design, but can make workable with a few tweeks. Does a great job for me."
R1X33OPIO3VGYF,Fit perfect and arrived quickly.
R257HX9XMSK6IF,Bricks arrived in perfect condition in a foam lined box.Seems sturdy so far and ready to do the job.
R2XJD7TBDJAEBD,Came broken and missing screws
RAF3CWE1TK45K,They work but much cheaper than the original OEM
RXCCLVUFPSHBN,Working good so far.
R38HS9XBG9EVR1,We was disappointed when it was delivered the top lip on the front of the stove was broken in the shipping. We will still use the stove but takes away from the appearance.
R1VYSDZ13PZ7MQ,"Produces unique flames.Piece of mind.Operates 12 to 40 hours down to coals, between feedings.Produces heat similiar to an old Fisher fireplace insert.This stove makes manufactures products in the $1,000s retail look sad. Burns clean.Does not produce smoke into the air."
R12N1DQZJX8YA6,"This stove was bought for occasional use and not having blower and feeder motors along with PC boards is what appealed to me and after setup, the stove works great. The main issue is how it is packaged for delivery. It came with a plastic bag dust cover stretch wrapped to a crappy repaired pallet. The pellet hopper was damaged and the area around the feed lid was pushed in and was out of shape. The feed lid and hinge rod were gone...fell through the dust cover and pallet. I was able to straighten out the sheet metal on the hopper and feed lid area as I did not want to send back and waste another day waiting for a delivery van that was an hour and half late from agreed delivery time. Good news was US Stove customer service sent me another feed lid and hinge/gasket to complete the fix. I also told them they need to fix how these are packaged, pallet slip sheets on bottom and top and strapped to the pallet...Would have been 5 stars if not for the bad packaging."
R2MS3F1NDIQORW,It came missing the flue collar
R1FVGGWA3DZDFV,works greatgood value
R2UHDU5O8OO04F,Like the product the look and craftmanship thou the hing pins could have been better suited with cotter pins then using a fine threaded screw.
R14T0KP8ARUPY9,"This product is really disappointing. Bought it over the summer when installing new wood stove in shop. Not a simple install, or change out due to the flue piping but fan has very little air movement. And the noise it makes every time it cuts on sounds like metal rubbing against metal. Save yourself the hassle I am dealing with and buy one that maybe has better reviews."
R36VH5ZPJVPB1Z,Very easy to install and a great value for my money
R21DVEPJ1HO3PE,We used it for the wood burning stove in our garage.
RQZFDRP8CPIPH,"Extremely well packed in a tight fitting cube of polyurethane foam 2 inches thick on all 6 sides.Bricks were quality pumice bricks, perfect condition, fit my quadrafire as they should."
R1LQDPZ20P0DO9,The legs are much shorter than I anticipated and because it's cast iron it rusted almost instantly.I used some heat resistant paint you can get cheap at any hardware store and coated the whole thing a few times which seems to have stopped that.Overall a good product. Wouldn't mind seeing it a bit cheaper or with a stove pipe though.
RMC04UYF12WWK,"Its Chinese cast iron, its rough around the edges, pitted, etc, but it does what its supposed to do. The double barrel kit isn't really shaped to the curves of a 55 gallon drum so it requires some fines and fitting. hard to beat for the price."
RQ4R8EQKHZQIZ,Good deal
R5IUB8S1J30OM,Heavy duty fits perfect
R34LYCMMDZANN8,"I received said item exactly when it was said it would be here, I was disappointed that part of the mounting flange was bent, and the little fan that keeps the magnets cool was broken during shipping, unfortunately I had to do what I could since it was only going to be thirty degrees tonight and can’t be without the heat"
R1ZJKZN6EMDFZS,"These were the exact replacements needed to get the wood stove insert at our cabin up and running. I compared these to the worn bricks coming out and they appear to be an exact match. They were extremely well packaged and not one damaged brick out of either box. After replacing the broken glass and the damaged and missing bricks, we can finally have a fire!"
RR2XVFRWJEFUQ,Easy Install. Looks great. So far so good. Will update after a few burns !!
R2HI4LPGK6CJL6,Legs are cast at wierd angles. Mounting pads do not follow curve of barrel and are all less than 90 degrees from vertical. Do they work yes but do they fit good or look good no.
R29DZKM58A8GFZ,"This kit is a HELLUVA lot more difficult to put together than you think it would be.For example, it doesn't tell you to buy barrels with rings on one end so that you can access the barrel in order to put the bolts through the holes.Also, in the two barrel setup, the ""separator"" legs don't fit the barrels correctly, and when you try to get help from US Stove, they don't have email!They do have text, and a facebook page, both of which I accessed, but got no help or support.I would highly advocate going to a different company with 1) better product with correct fit, 2) better and complete instructions, and 3) a decent level of customer support."
R2DLU4VN1JM1DE,good
R2S5Q2SG24ICKF,Using these bricks for a forge. I drilled holes and use two mapp/pro torches. They worked well for one cycle after the second use they cracked and failed. I do not recommend.
R1CL5VUXXDG298,Love it
R1OUFAGWUBT0HF,The barrel supports do not fit the contour of a standard 55 gallon drum and the feet are not at a right angle as many other reviewers have mentioned. If the stove pipe fittings were purchased separately I would opt to go that route and build my own supports that fit the drums better.They need to reengineer their molds.
R1Q38DWTUN4Q6N,Great fit
RISXSMWLA8N5D,Installed perfect. No issues. Stove heats wood shop great.
R14CQ3VEU1EJRI,"Replaced the original flimsily door that was rotted out.Had to chip a little bit of the old mortar out.Installed with construction adhesive, let it sit for a few days before putting the door on, looks great.Very heavy door, would 100% recommend.To answer the question does it lock, the door will lift off the hinge part, when you close it, it pushes up a little and locks into the groove.Not what I would call a lock, but is a sturdy a closing mechanism."
RRIAV55OT5TC8,Worked really well replacing the firebricks in my woodstove
R17LEQCQE2HMC,Well packaged in dense foam to prevent damage.Arrived in perfect condition.
R1IZL4J5FRRDKO,works great!
R1BSQQI02KBHVR,Good replacement for the very worn bricks in the wood stove I inherited at our new house
R32SVXF8V3YJD1,Works amazing
RNA7KJ4YRFES9,Okay as is
R1FW459XHM6RTP,Good fits on all the parts easy to install
RMWHFBVVITD6T,The price versus the amount
RBRI2UNOZV8PN,"I bought a Wiseway Gravity fed pellet stove 2 years ago, to replace a wood stove I had for ten years. With the wood stove I had no problems keeping my house at 90 degrees during the coldest of winters. I live in the Carson valley just below the mountains which hold Lake Tahoe.I have the pellet stove for 2 full seasons. The good, if power and gas goes out pellet stove keeps running. If your house is less then 1400 square feet this pellet stove will heat your house. The stove is super easy to clean... kind of, removing ash is easy. However, after a couple of season you will get some creosote build up just above the burn basket and some in the bends of the stove, this is very hard to get out.Also you will get some accumulation of ash is the bends after the burn window which are also hard to clean. Now, it won't stop the stove from running but it will hamper its efficiency. After about a month of service, I use my electric leaf blower to blow all the ash up out of the chimney.I cover the stove in light plastic for any cracks in which the ash might escape.The Wiseway pellet stove has idiosyncrasy in its operation. Theburn basket spacing is ideal at5/16” between each metal bar, much wider or and it effects the stove efficiency. I've read if open the spacing it makes it run hotter that has not been my experience. Also downdrafts really effect the stoves operation, if you live in an area of strong winds or if your chimney riser is not higher then the crest of your house you may have issues. I just installed a vacu-stack chimney cap in hopes it would limit downdrafts, I won't know if it will help until a full season. It cost me about $70 and I should mention I had to buy another burn basket last season $65. The burn baskets don't last long especially if you constantly tweak them like I have mine. So, in retrospect I regret my purchase. Had I purchased some electric pellet stove I may feel the same way. Remember I am comparing this pellet stove to a wood stove. We have not lost the power in three years, had I lost the power for a week or two my review would be totally different. My Wiseway Pellet stove keeps my house between 70 and 71 degrees.Ultimately I have to work a little to keep my this pellet stove working, not as hard as I did with burning wood (cutting, splitting, stacking, starting a fire).I just started the pellet stove for the first time this season, it is primed, cleaned and has the new chimney cap and it has been running at 400 degrees, when it's dirty with internal ash (not in the burn basket, second burn chamber or ash tray) it struggles to get to 300 degrees which is 65 degrees in my house. . The first week I had the stove it ran a 500 degrees, it has not ever since. If the stove ran at 500 degrees I would have given it 5 stars.When it's time I will get an electric pellet stove, we'll unless we lose the power allot. To be completely transparent I bought the Wiseway pellet stove to rely less on electric and natural gas. I will update this review should the new chimney cap help.November 26, 2019 up date: I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5. With the vacu-stack stove cap, adjusting the burn pot close to"".290, or on a tape measure the closest mark would be just under the 19/64”mark"" and burning, ""Golden Fire pellets"" my stove is burning at 500 to 600 degrees. Outside it is a balmy 11 degrees fahrenheit, inside its 79 degrees and I am in shorts. So.... if you put the work in the stove works well. I am happy... for now."
R59FXGTDA0NAV,This fits perfectly. My old one finally burned through the metal completely. The stove must be 15 or 20 years old. It was time to replace this part.
R9WA583PXR5LZ,"This came in one piece, well packaged. No problem and it fit the American Harvest Pellet Stove perfectly."
RFS5P4EQEP26J,"Amazon had best price going. Love the fact hopper will hold 3 40lb bag. This is a nice looking stove. The men who delivered this were on time and brought inside. I've only started a few times , why only 4 stars. Time will tell. This is my second stove, last one being englander.i have read trouble with ignitors, I've used blow tourch in past. As of now, it's Great"
R2YVIHV55G37X,JUNK! Had to a screw to keep the door shut would never buy again!!
R1Q60AMJU3KL2M,"Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the BKAD500 Cast Iron Double Barrel Stove Adaptor . Castings are rather thin, they are rough, and not much attention was given to de-burring, etc.The barrel attaching saddles are not at a 90* angle with the vertical sections, and need to be modified.I'm disappointed and may end up returning them."
R1NSQ1Q7E2U1M5,"I use this brick for its intended purpose -for lining the interior of a wood stove.I have used several brands of fire brickand find this brand to be undesirable.It appears to be a dried mix of silica or glass with some pebbles and some sort of binder which gives the bricks a definite rough surface. When I attempt to cut the brick it invariably breaks wrong. It has a short lifein the wood stove.Another brand I use (unnamed) has a smooth surface, is denser, tends to break correctly, but is more difficult to cut,and lasts long in the stove.This other brick is difficult to find on the market and that is typical of better products."
R5KB38G1IX2G2,Arrived at my house today broken and missing multiple parts. I’ll be requesting a replacement or refund.
R1HTPDZVNDDWAT,Kit was great however stacked stove design has draft issues. That's not on seller though.
R17G3ORD6U17YZ,just what I wanted. too add to my stove.
R1MVXSD0GJJ0QI,Perfect fit
R2E92M06CTWL3C,I replaced our rusted out steel doors for these. Easy to install. Looks great.
R35F6WM1WYEIUA,Good product at a good price
R22EG8WIDW0S8U,Recived item broken
R39ATVSTV4WCL8,"they were really good for the first season, but they started to crumblein the next . so it was a quick fixfor a little while."
R18QDQM0NR5HYL,wood burning fireplace
R25V9893Y8USGG,"Yes the stove could use some modifications!!! I've had my stove for 3 winter's now. Burn it 24/7. Still on the first burn basket.... but have re-welded the side bars of the basket once. Live in the NEK (Vermont) cold and snowy. USSC claims it can heat a 2000 sf...maybe below the Mason Dixon line. 🤔 We use it to supplement our heating system. Stove is located in the lower floor living space( walk out basement) and it heats the upper floor and loft comfortablly if temperatures don't dip below 20 degs. Total sf about 2400.My main gripe is....it's not easy to clean the fly ash from the upper portion of the heating chamber ( ""Z"" box pipe). It takes time and creativity to do so, not to mention the mess.So your more apt to skip that portion..not cleaning every time. Not cleaning the upper portion reduces the draft which drastically reduces the burn efficiency and heat output.Sooo...My son and I just installed this easy access clean out. This will reduce my""complete"" cleaning time down to 20 mins👍😁. Takes about the same amount of time to clean a standard wood stove."
R1CVWUP413G55O,Decent product.For the most part it’s pretty easy to install and works well.The only thing I noticed is that it could use larger ventilation holes at the bottom for I find myself leaving the door open so that it can get enough oxygen.And a small tip is to make sure the barrel you get is totally flat on the sides.Mine has small ripples on the sides that make it difficult to get a good seal with for the chimney.
R3HX3H4DCILOH9,ok for wood stove
RETYY22Y0U72A,Love this pellet stove!After having a couple of electricity ran pellet stoves my Wiseway is a delight! Heats our 1845 sq ft home perfectly.It’s place in the same area as our return air duct with the fan running in intervals to push the heat to the rest of the house.Radiant heat is the best!
R3DZ8DCIPY5CI5,"Nothing flashy. Just a cast iron, nice and solid, well built chimney access door. Standard size, easy to install (you'll need mortar, of course). Fixes a problem easily."
R39PDAEZR0T04H,Great Product
RAGJS33OEHDKR,"They are easy to cut a hole through for my forge burner, I do wish that they came in a package of 8"
R22L8GD4VMB2W0,"quality was ok, but package was in horrible shape..."
R13L22Q8NK677Z,Seems to work so far.No installation instructions included.Check youtube on how to remove and insert pivot pin.
R1SIN57CGVG4A9,"Had a blower motor go on my US Stove Hot Blast after 10 years...though I could limp along with one of the two...nope, furnace getting too hot.Pricey, but installed easily, working perfectly couple of years now.Had a panic moment, couldn't turn the fan on the new one, then discovered it's totally immobilized with foam packing!"
R2RXP0X4NWM220,"Fits in our fire stove much better than what was in it. Logs have stopped falling off, eliminating the frustration."
R1XY1BCX4TMWBY,Too small
RDKLDU6RLF4TR,The single barrel kit went together perfectly but this kit was awful. The brackets don’t sit flat on the barrels and it’s almost impossible to get a wrench on the nuts to tighten them down without cutting the face of the barrel out and the chimney connection they expect you to use won’t fit a standard 6in single wall pipe without having to modify the pipe. I genuinely regret buying this product and don’t feel safe using it in my barn. I now have to start over on my stove because of this
R6Z2EQG5AG98B,"the adapter kit sort of fit. the cast iron was decent enough. it came with all the necessary parts. the curve for the brackets didn't quite match the curve of the barrel I was using so there was a good 1/4"" gap around all the brackets. not something I would use if you wanted a complete air seal."
R1BN6GEVDRJH3X,Excellent
R2HYC9798SEMWD,Cast iron looks so much better than other materials.
R31CRZIDJ014NI,Replaced very old rickety rusted door. Fit right in the opening. Oil the cast iron to keep it looking good.
RUS5PH2P4DSHT,Easy to install.
R2OIYFSEWKY40N,"This was a perfect replacement for our aging cleanout.I do not know why anyone would say it does not latch!It lateches fine.The door is heavy and I coated with rustolium clear coat twice on inside and out.I mixed up some cement, slathered on all sides. Went in like a glove.I think being cast iron it will last for another 50 years.I definitely recommend if you need to replace an 8x8"" cleanout."
R24WGVCH57LWJD,"This was a very solid and substantial clean out door, and it would have been perfect except it was too big.If I were selling this item, I would post pictures detailing all dimensions and identifying critical dimensions like ""masonry opening"" so that you can match this product with the hole you're trying to stick it into.Return was easy.The 8"" seems to be standard while my old atomic bungalow has a massive chimney but a very tiny clean out with the very outer edge of the entire door and flange measuring 8"", so my masonry opening is maybe 5 & 3/4""."
R2S22LAD19OIHZ,Good product for the price.
R8XU2S7JXTF3M,Good product for the price.
RWDLHBPZDZM0D,They came in a very thick foam and nine were broken or damaged. They looked well packed a great buy!
R1JX3JOLSPX67P,"Stove kit was easy to install with a drill, jigsaw, and simple hand tools.Works well on my 55 gallon barrel pool heater.The stove is definitely NOT air tight so you can't use it indoors, but I knew that coming into this.My only complaint, and maybe mine is just missing parts, but there is no knob for the door lever, so you have to figure out how to get ahold of a hot little chunk of metal to unlatch and open the door. The box was damaged when I got it, so it's possible pieces are missing but it's not important enough to worry about."
R23156JCM1ZSZU,"I loved it ,it fit perfect and was so easy to install. I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you"
RR9AW7INBF0XV,Cheap
R1VP2HPS6RBF4F,Good product
R1GNV5MHYX38G9,My husband makes barrel stoves and has ordered this door kit twice. It is a great product and he has not had any issues with either of them.
R1HFXK8T40R6T5,Good deal
R2YBO7IVKCRS5M,These are packaged superbly and of the 24 I ordered in two separate orders ZERO arrived broken or damaged.These are packaged better than anything I've ever received.The bricks cut very easy on my tile and stone saw and the fit for our 50 year old fire place turned out perfect!
R35N2C9O9PPPTJ,Great
R2O0FBFY1VTTSK,Rusted way to easy
RYXTQCNA8E6Q7,Came with everything we needed. Worked out real nice.
RE2HUVIG68GIJ,We had to return the other stove kit as a leg was broken in the box. This set wee had no issues with.
RQBSZDI92YXAC,Easy to install
R15IRFJY0TVM05,Was way easier to install than I thought.
R145E0385IYWPA,Did what it's expected to do.
RJLC10X9SLJKJ,Did what it's expected to do.
R1J0RTSGPRD9NK,I like a lot. Lightweight and with double staggered walls was a great choice for my homemade kiln.
R3K6TR2VXI37T8,"Arrived well-packed and intact. We use them to line the bottom of a fire pit, packed in sand. Exactly what we needed."
R354J7OYNVP52S,Didn't fit real well onto barrel s
RYFKOI5CUUA3T,Have had this installed for over 2 years nowand it is still holding up great.
RJVEL9T1F0EDD,Easy install and sturdy
R2GTLMX2JPUSG7,I purchased these to use as a fire barrier in my weber kettle. I placed them in a square and left. After 4 uses I noticed one of them cracked in half. These are rated to 2400 degrees??
RA0GV8U2SO750,Exactly as described
R1QSXIKN4G0G91,I got these for apropane forge without a fan. They melted and sagged in about 20-30 minutes. The Manufacturer said they were rated to 2400F which is the maximum temperature of a propane forge. I know theyare not sold for this but the manufacturer said they were rated for up to 2400 They were quite well packed so I have to give credit for that
R1KIL1SGWYJETP,Ordene este articulo pero la puerta me llego doblada
RC6G7K8J1J7TK,what I needed.
R5QYUO3GE07OQ,As described!
R1ZBGJSD1E6P44,Perfect
R1DDFMZ9M4KBI0,Works on our wood pellet stove
R3R33XU8RT32YD,couple fires became brital and broke
R21F1ICD1ZPBG5,Grate sags in the middle after use due to the heat of the log.
R1QG5BBR7QA51O,works ok
R12VEMO614BNPS,"This grate fits my wood burning stove and helps with maintaining an efficient fire. Just keep in mind that is is a one season use only item. Just ordered grate #4 in the same number of years and will continue to do so. It simply can not hold up to the heat. I have not seen a grate in modern production that can. It helps keep a normal $300/month electric bill to $70/month during the winter. It is worth it, just keep in mind that you are not buying a lifetime product."
R2OTL828YL3P9,aye the delivery guy couldve tossed this at a non fire brick wall and theyde be fine definitly gonna buy again when these get too hot for the forge. also very easy to cut. WEAR A MASK LOTS OF DUST!!!
R31G4AZ4W15JBK,Has worked well since I installed it.
R2FCDSUIHYXUV8,"Perfect fit and quick, easy installation. Should last a long time."
R3VBTA7CLMLR1X,gets rusty inside but expected that i like it it works ok and looks better than a pot of water
R1PLAOO3H3MZJU,The grate is very easy to replace .The only complaint is it only least a year. That being said maybe I shouldn't think it should last longer.Yes I would purchase again.
RSGMXZ1HAXXCR,worked good
R1233UOZ4SS1UD,these cast pieces aren't even close to parallel on the barrel mating surfaces. do not buy. it cracked and broke on the first fire due to the stress.
R4A8BGPN3UZT3,worked as new part should. very satisfied
RUA0YDUIKY4W4,Like
R23MYJE39L1MWJ,Sent this to my son for Christmas. He uses it to reduce Maple Sap to Maple Syrup. He just sent me a quart of Maple Syrup. It was so good. Barrel must work as advertised.
RTUQEPU95IFD2,"First, I would like to say I do not understand how the same company produces both of these kits. The kit with door has a decent fit of the lower legs to the barrel. However, the double barrel adapter kit has a completely different angle that is absolutely horrible. The tangent with the barrel is on the very inside of the leg. I was too lazy to return this so I used one of the legs and a reinforced stack pipe to support the barrel. To hide the horrible clearances and give adequate support, I placed hardened silicone rubber in the .125-.6"" (yes, this big) clearances and hid the dissatisfying appearance with stove sealant. I painted over all when done. I should not have to do this. I didn't listen to reviews because I figured the people using this kit were probably not as mechanically skilled as I am. This part is just sized wrong and does not go with the lower kit at all. Plan on spending hours making the barrels fit with these legs, and 30-60$ in sealants and hightemp rubber material."
ROY9RASXFT9RS,"I am using these in a gas forge to block up one end to Insulate the forge.They are very brittle after being exposed to forge heat. I understand it’s a brick and it will break if dropped, but I am talking about picking it up by one end and it snapping in half.Granted, this is from the insane heat generated by a forge, so using it in an oven for cooking/heating it would probably be fine. I tried these due to price, guess I’m gonna have to shell out more $$ for the thicker ones.Packaging was great though! Came in a custom made foam box which was in a cardboard box. Nice tight fit, you can order with an easy mind knowing they won’t show up broken."
R18DOOYYMF4ZNC,"they are ok, I should have researched more"
R1PMN4H5N9IHU5,It was a five minute install. The motor is quiet and powerful just what we were looking for.
R31Q4ZKFXXI66M,Works great-good price -easy set up
R39BWVSBIEUG2T,cocorico
R2D9Z1RFR5MOJ3,Wow piece of crap! One gear has no teeth left! The motor spins but no teeth on that 1 gear to spin the rest of the gears!
R1EIAKHWV7UZUH,To replace it you must remove the firebricks first then it goes much easier. Not sure its possible without that. I used a rubber mallet to tap the back edge up out of its flange. Then I used a few screwdrivers to flex the back edge toward you so it will drop all the way down. It took a few tries to figure this out but once I did it went fine. The more warped the baffle the harder it may be. I would check the baffle every year and replace before it gets too warped. I vacuumed out the back flange so the new one dropped right in.
R3PYSXACQOAO1A,Worked great. Some of the nuts and bolts are inferior but are easily replaced with traditional sized nuts and bolts.
RP1CWCFGSU70E,My order was terminated
R5POST5KOYOC7,Good
R1V98RHRKYH90E,Came in very well packaged. Not one chip or cracked brick.
R1UIEPSHNUPR6V,"Chimney clean out door is as advertised, great price. Should last for many years."
RO18HRVQFYOAZ,Not the best for use in a forge. Turn pink and have pink stain after being heated. Cracked in half after about 5 heatings in the forge. Not rated for the temps that were stated in the description.
R2OR8DMNNQ10AY,Good quality. Fit perfect
R1X2EZL08SWUKW,Product was used for a wood burning stove.
R3KKNK1BXUAOBY,"The bricks a great! I ordered two packs one was broke out of the two. But that's understandable. But the sent me 9""×4.5""×1.25"" and I ordered 9""×4.5""×1.5"""
R300GTJH798IAM,Installed into my pellet stove was very easy to install. Runs sooooo much better and quieter then the original. Wife came home and said it was not working right it was so much quieter.
RRH2T191TYU98,As expected. Nice product pack
RBSR2M6C15KPI,i t was just what i needed for my wood stove....i give it a 10....fix perfect
R2ZY00UJ4768KK,Went in perfectly to my blaze king insert wood stove
RARGBR870V286,Great quality product however the flew pipe that goes on top of the barrel won’t fit a standard stove pipe.
R531N9K1FE676,"I received this item toward the end of our winter season here in Northern Montana, so take this with a grain of salt.The installation was a breeze and assembly was very, very simple.The stove's simple design was easy to understand when I began fussing with it.The fit and finish left a little bit to be desired but this stove is definitely on the utilitarian side of the spectrum so not really a big deal.My only worry is there might be an issue with the integrity of the welds but its something we can fix.I made sure to burn it outside first to remove the 'gunk' leftover from manufacturing (I would highly recommend doing this as it put off LOTS of smoke).It feeds pellets well and gets up to temperature quickly.We opted for this option for one simple reason: there is no need for electricity.This is our only viable, long term heat source in our home and we simply couldn't take the chance of losing power and thus losing heat.I have some apprehension about its ability to keep our home warm during our coldest winter months but time will tell.I will update after next winter.EDIT:Ive been burning this stove for about a month now and I have to say, I am really enjoying it.It does take a little tinkering to get the right pellet, draft, etc but once you know your stove (and when to clean it) it puts off quite a bit of heat.I will update this again sometime next winter when the cold has really set in here in northern Montana.Update - Year 2:We are 3.5 months into operating our stove this winter and I thought I'd share our experience.We changed or chimney setup from a ~20' vertical pipe to a 15' vertical pipe with 2x 90 degree angles to take the chimney out our wall and up through our eve.This goes AGAINST the manufacturers recommendations and they are absolutely correct in recommending against the installation of elbows.The stove heats our living space well enough but it does not burn nearly as hot as it was before (previously 550-650F fully closed, currently 400-500F fully closed).While it does heat our home there are a few big problems created by this change in function.First and foremost, the reduced operating temperature creates SIGNIFICANTLY more ash.Due to constant smoking and low operating temps I check on the condition of my 3"" ID stove pipe used to draft/vent the stove.It was constricted by over 50% due to the build up of ash which is incredibly problematic considering the amount we've burned the stove this winter.Secondly, the fuel efficiency is reduced fairly significantly because it isn't fully consumed.This causes more frequent clean outs of the bottom ash tray as well as clearing the clinker tray because the partially consumed pellets die and clump up on the plate.While Im not yet regretting this purchase I certainly did not do myself any favors when installing my new chimney.If you are going to install this chimney yourself make sure you follow the manufactures recommendations of running it straight up, no matter how inconvenient that may be.NOTE: If you do decide to order this product, be ready to wait quite a while for it to be delivered.If it is shipped with NSD they took an additional 3 weeks past the anticipated delivery date.Call them right off the bat and hound them until its delivered.They had dismal customer service but the squeaky wheel gets the grease."
R14F7AC35MFZ1A,the door and door flange do not meet up well and you can see light all around the door.Will not keep coals burning overnight.
R1NHHWKKPAVTEX,"I'm re-topping & replacing ash door on customers masonry chimney. Castings look nice. Bad door seal latch and hinges don't fit frame well, causing 1/8"" air leak between frame & door. Not good for improve chimney draft.Made in China, looks good in picture for online purchase."
R1QA4O81BFKD43,"No problems. Installed, plugged it in. Excelsior!@"
R3FQFG8XXUDB45,"Works for a large garage, makes alot of heat quick but door doesn't seal very well so I get smoke Everytime I after I refill untill it's burning good again. I'll probably buy a real stove for next year."
R2GDLCUUZU3NAF,"Rattles, won't work at slower speeds ...junk, look elsewhere"
RIKAVZ89BIJEZ,Had to install the fan blade it fell off but worked good after that
R10QJ2ZF7ENAUX,Great replacement for original in my heater
R2OJL9TG82T462,Perfect fit and runs great
R11H23H2FMPKAZ,I used them to line my forge and am very happy with the results.
R1PA3PI13BRD3O,Very brittle and turn to glass.There's better quality for this price range.
R9GQH4RCKZOG4,"I use fire bricks to block up my gas forge during smithing. These melted after a few days. Literally melted into the forge, which will need to be relined. Definitely avoid and get some proper bricks."
R1AZO8E7E1ZIYJ,A+
R3GBQZC7LAO2SG,The product restored the function of the Wondercoal Heater!!Hope the price would be a tad lower though.
R2M77JB8KWF1Q2,"This was an excellent purchase decision. My wife and I love wood heat, but the amount of dust that the fan on our wood furnace was pushing throughout the house was very bothersome. Our wood furnace is in our basement and connected into our houses duct work. The dust and dirt from the wood was then carried all through the house when the fan kicked on. The filter box arrived totally disassembled, but was relatively easy to put together and install with the included instructions. The entire process took less than two hours. Since we have installed the box, the amount of dust in our home has decreased dramatically! Very pleased with this product!"
RJN865TMZNW3G,This grate is pretty heavy duty and has been working well this cold winter.
R38Y1RE80V8J7Z,Exactly as described.Works great!
R2UH05531KW7XT,"These arrived very well packed and none were broken.I was able to place them in my woodstove for immediate usage.post-installation.I was concerned about them breaking if they were hot and a piece of wood hit them when going into the stove.The concern wasn't based on poor manufacturing, it was just me being uncertain on how they would do.I have been using the stove quit extensively this year and am happy to report that I have not had any issues with them cracking."
RWMC520VU5BQ7,These FireBricks are exactly as stated. Solid construction at a great delivered price.
R2D0X167W2UA9J,"I bought the barrel stove kit because I hated burning in a barrel with a screen on top. This is much safer. The only problem I have is that it does not draw well. I have to leave the door open a quarter of an inch to get it to burn. It was designed to burn wood, and I am burning trash so that might be the reason."
R3QIAKT5IU6SWF,I used this to make a double barrel burn barrel
R3PIVVKWLYEPF0,"The pieces are cast without any contour for the barrels.Additionally, the stands are nowhere near being 90 degrees in respect to the mounting surface, so the barrels need to be bent excessively in order for these things to fit.Nearly impossible to align the holes to drill the barrels out.Very poor quality.I returned mine immediately."
R2R0Y0LSG34XGM,works as described.
R1H02FTCI5J07I,"Arrived packed in large foam outer case surrounding the bricks.All in perfect condition.Removed the old pieces, shop vac the fire box, replace the old bricks and done.Repeat in a few years.I'll have to cut some next time to redo the floor of the wood stove but that is for next time...."
R355NOK96NII97,"Worked exactly as hoped. I wanted something a bit more sturdy than a 55 gallon drum so I went to the local scrap yard and bought a 26"" scrap steel pipe 1/4 inch thick. I also had some scrap boiler tubes on my property that I used to make a blower system. I did not use the included legs since it ways a couple hundred pounds. All in all it was a great product and am thinking about building a couple more!"
R1PLLZYKRQTPEL,I’ve been looking for a small sized stove top humidifier as most are really big and we only have a tiny wood stove. This pot is both decorative and functional and does the job. I followed others advice on reviews and seasoned it before using and so hopefully it won’t rust.I’m really happy with this product.
R1QDFXG6GI7JM1,"Great!! We actually used this to create a radiant floor secondary heat system from our wood stove. Worked great!! Though that certainly wouldn't be enough to heat the water alone, but it does a great job boosting the temperature. The parts were very high quality!"
RJ7Y8Q9D2ZAZJ,I live in New England has a real hard time with 700 Sq ft.
R25GNHVCWJMD49,"Quality product, fit stove 40257 as stated..Easily installed."
R3D148NNB9JTI0,they will rape you on you partsextreamly full retail
R260RASIC2PNH4,"The idea of having a non electric pellet stove is great for our solar home. However, the stove does not heat high enough. After a cleaning, having really dry softwood pellets, and having the setting on high, we are lucky to get it to 500 degrees. The only time it works great is when the burn basket is compromised and it allows for a LOT of pellets to drop. Compromised means the metal bars burn away. But when too many pellets get through, this causes problems as well. You need to replace the burn basket at least once a season, sometimes twice at $45 a piece."
R1VV05F7LG0LJK,"You have to screw the legs on verses being a one piece casting. I use mine on top of the stove to dry wood gloves, whatever. I'm pretty sure if you intend to use it inside the stove, you'd be better off getting a grate that is made of welded steel. these cast thing don't usually last too long at stove temps."
R2J5C76LX8VOXR,They are not made to use in a forge. I used them in my two burner forge and they melted
R2QOO3MWD7FPL9,easy to install-- works great
R393DQT8LT42RA,I recieved this grate in good time and was easy to install. It's been in my stove for a little over a month and so far no troubles and I keep a pretty hot fire in my stove at all times.
R3NY124US9VCDA,VERY reasonable and dropped right in.
R1LQGAI2F2E8LI,The door is strong but when you closed it it doesn’t locked all the way
R1SEJN78WJUF0M,"Great product and so much cheaper than buying in store, have had it running in my stove for over a year now and it’s still going strong!"
R2K9S4TMIWAO84,Easy to install and nice to have if the fire gets too hot
R1G9DERXZ3IFB2,"The product fit my stove perfectly.As an Amazon Prime member, with free shipping I got them cheaper than getting them directly from the manufacturer!"
R3LX9UN0L72E1O,"I ended up lying for two of these because the THIRD one I received still didn’t work right and I didn’t send it back in time. So I got charged for two. Let me repeat, I had 3 malfunctioning products. Now I’m stuck with it."
R1VDVT3ESKS96F,Availability and price
R2PSZD731KQW6O,Was rusted after the first day. Now the rust has started to move to the exterior.
R18J0RKFF4JR1F,"This was our first purchase for our wood furnace so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this showed up with nice heavy gauge steel.I would've preferred it came with hardware to transition from piping in the house but I can shop that out later.Anxious to get it hooked up and start using it"
REVKGQUPZB7QB,Great kit! Great quality!!
RKY29HNA9QE5U,The price is insane
R2QEB66GA8MR8V,all good
RX6GL1N28VCSW,The door slides off of jam easilyAlso has a draft hole built inThe collar for stove pipe isSet up to fit on barrel sides not bottomWhere it is flat
R3DHB2EV7ALXQY,"Package arrived with NO installation instructions, but there was a video on YouTube, which made the install much easier."
R221119SSZXK6X,"Bought to put on top of pellet stove, the inside of it rusted within 2 weeks was not happy"
RPCIWFSFFTWO4,Works as it should. Good price. Packaging was a bit sketchy. Heavy item in a lightweight box. It tore the box in transit. Might want to use a heavier box! It was not damaged inside.Kudos to them for shipping it priority after I contacted them and told them mine died ( it had just been making noises) at no extra charge.
R28BK4CW6BOZGZ,I bought the grate less then 5 months ago and it is already warped and about ready to fail.
R879HX2JWDHJ9,Order a replacement for my American Harvest stove and it fit PERFECTLY!!
R2EILOCI2C5IRR,"We have 3, 5500M from Ashley/US Stove Company in our Family. I’ve had mine for 6 heating season (currently in the 7th). The igniters are JUNK, purchased and replaced the igniter twice on 2 of the stoves we have...now I just use a torch, it’s faster anyway. We do proper maintenance, Spring and Fall as well as clean the vent kit weekly in all of them.We love the stoves, can’t beat them for the money."
R3KD1PBXZPUFU8,exactly what I needed and fast shipping
R82AYUO8HB0SD,Looking forward to making our stove!
R3D594J0BV5ULB,"I didn't want to spend any more money than I had to to get a wood burning stove. This kit fit the bill. I got a steel barrel with a removable lid and within an hour, I had the stove assembled. You will need a saw that can cut steel well or it will take a lot longer. I have been using the stove for about two months and have had fires over 750 degrees (that is the highest my thermometer will read) with no issues. The kit fits 55 gallon drums very well. The parts are curved to fit the sides exactly. The door has a spring handle that is cool to the touch. I think that the flue is the same, but have always had gloves on when I adjust it, so I can't say for sure. The barrel is probably bigger than most cheap wood stoves and the airflow is such that very little smoke enters the room. The only issue I have is that the legs are only about 4-6 inches long. I'm going to have to build a platform for it so I'm not crawling on the floor to fill it. I am very happy with the stove that this kit allowed me to build."
R3W0W0IX6QKMUX,Use this in my shop for winter warmth. This is my second season and it’s still going strong
R135J4K3J2GVN7,It was what I needed & fit great. I used for my American Harvest pellet stove.
REM4NATHRAOFX,Great product
R4037DKF1PIZN,pain to install but arrived fast
RVEFQ416X4C39,"goes thru wood like crazy I can burn a cord in 2 weeks needs double barrel or a baffle but it could save your life with a good draft no smoke exists the door,. By the gasket unit better control on night burns. Definitely need cast iron grateso your in for 200 bucks for the parts paint and about 3 hours labor.My tip I used the bottom of the barrel no bung holes ,Used self tappers to hold the door in place and the drilled 4-2'and cut to them so I have nice smooth corners GOOD LUCK"
RX466L0DR4LVA,This is the perfect stove kit. Easy assembly.
R1P22XQ720CPZR,"I ordered this agitator motor for my U.S. Stove model 6039 on Saturday, as I recall, and was given a guaranteed delivery date of the following Wednesday. Without my pellet stove, in this 2200 ft. farm house that's about 200 years old, my oil furnace runs continuously. In 2 1/2 days it burned over it burned 65 gallons of fuel at 3 bucks a gallon. With my U.S. Stove model 6039 pellet burner the furnace barely ever coomes on unless it's really, really cold. The agitator mtor is a very important part and, without it, it's extremely difficult to run. You can do it, if you want to sit and watch it 24/7, I don't. Well as it turns out the part arrived on Tuesday, a day early and, as I had already taken the stove apart and thoroughly cleaned, It took all of 10 minutes to install the new part and get it up and running. Thank God and Amazon that it arrived when it did because it was on Wednesday, the Polar Vortex hit and the temperatures plunged to at least ten below and stayed that way for 2 days. It's only +3 as I write this today and yesterday it never made it above zero. Amazon's prompt delivery saved me a bundle in oil bills and hotel rooms. They couldn't have timed it any better. That's why I'm an Amazon customer for life, they always come through in a pinch."
R3LO46LGL4P8D2,"Installed few weeks back. We burn all winter long, all types of wood which results in variable heat temperatures. Is a thinner gauge metal then in original kit. Will see how long it lasts. ONLY ONE IN BOX, NOT A FRONT AND REAR SET. Will fit front or rear, poor advertising by seller!"
RXWRZUSFOW0NL,Well Made
R1VJAT2PMH4OSL,"I am using this grate in a fireplace insert, which without any grate does not get enough air and makes more charcoal than ashes. The US Stove grate completely solved this problem, but cast iron material has sagged and swelled after four days' use. Other reviewers reported that it eventually breaks. I had not read the other reviews carefully enough to realize how quickly this failure takes place. I will be returning this toA m a z o nfor a full refund - I urge anyone else who has bought one of these recently and had the same problem to do the same. I am astounded that a company apparently keeps making and selling these defective grates, and thatA m a z o ngoes along with it.Update - I have not been able to find another grate the same size, and flat, so I am going to keep this one. The ONLY way to have it actually work is to support the middle of the grate so it doesn't sag and break. I'm doing this with a small fire brick. Mine is 1-1/4 inches thick, but a thickness of 1-1/2 inch would be about right if you start using it right away, before the grate has started to sag."
R1B01U7CC865NJ,"One hot fire, and the grate was warped (center sag) by almost an inch. It also does a very poor job of letting ash fall through and is very prone to clogging up. The problem is the top of the grate is completely flat versus other grates that are made of square-bar on edge. It helped with air flow for one fire, then was pretty much useless."
R15I3OWEQIX9IO,"I needed something for when the power goes out.I've had this stovefor several years and would like to comment on several key points.I ran it nearly every day last year. Had many back burn issues.Burn as hot as you can or it will make lots of creosote. The burn chamber is not designed to get hot enough to efficiently combust all the gasses. I was horrified to see how much creosote was built up...the whole pipe above the stove was completely blocked. How any airflow happened was by accident.The whole stove chambers were plugged. There is no access to effectively clean this stove.I plan to insulate the burn chamber on the outside of the stove with thermal brick or perlite. The whole lower chamber. That way all gasses are burned. I am considering cutting a whole inthe ends of the diagonals, so the stove can be cleaned properly. The creosote problem is dangerous."
R1QNUBC9B5BRUZ,I never write reviews but this product is crap just received yesterday and used it one night in my wood burner its already heat warped and the fire I had going was at a steady 400° I would like to have my money back and word for the wise to whom reads this please don't buy china crap buy made in the u.s.a. it may cost more but its worth it
R2VXSXXXCN2N9,"This item is the wrong size, how do I return it?"
R2PSJPYFQB2Z06,"Garbage, these melted into a big mess.Save yourself a headache."
RH8GF2NM9514K,Perfect fit
R14IHZBVUYRL32,Works fine in wood burning stove as replacement bricks
R2VI8AQJ8NF666,Works great. Seems to be good quality.
RVOR415ES0D8F,Worked great at first. However after three fires it looks like this. I’m anticipating it’ll be junk within a week. Some center supports would most likely solve this. Not happy at all.
R3ISQ4HOC6SEEP,"Excellent,will buy from them again , thank you"
R3Q69AOASMJA3G,"Paid overnight shipping, got here right away, works perfectly."
R3RJ2UF1JX8UCB,Replaced this stove part and it fit perfectly.
R3M5TRGEZ29WCY,"Despite the other reviews, the instructions with this thing say it is coated to prevent rust.It is not.The first one we ordered came broken, missing a big chunk with a crack, despite the good packaging.The second arrived intact but rusted after the first use.I’ll clean and coat it but note that the instructions specifically say that it is coated to prevent rust.It is very cute though and looks great on the stove."
R2GWSVKY7VIALK,"Rusted first day. Paperwork says it has a porcelain coating to resist rusting, but clearly it either doesn't have the coating or the coating doesn't work. I am going to season with oil like other cast iron, hopefully it will hold up without too much maintenance. Also, thought it would be made in the USA, but the box says made in China. Cast iron seems heavy enough, tough to say after only one day. We'll see how it seasons..."
R382KR52JOQ8Y3,Works fine. Blower comes on when the air is ready and goes off when it gets cold. If it doesn’t last very long or quits working correctly then I will be updating this review to reflect any shortcomings.
R269R0L6UABCB8,This is working out perfectly atop my wood stove. Fill it 90% with water and a few drops of scented oil and viola....lovely humidifier fragrance. Just remember this is cast iron so needs oiling occasionally to keep rust at bay.
R32215HGRGUD2Y,The price was high but I needed it so I paid .
R1MAVRAZJW9YAT,Picture was not what received. It di fit in my pellet so I was very happy that
R2O35Q2JQDZD87,Works good
R1F4RZ8UXUB2VO,US Stove design failed. Almost burned down my house. Fire got into the hopper with 30 lbs of fuel and I got home just in time to empty the black smoking pellets from the back. It was operating as designed too. And customer service won’t have it fixed.
R26VJA2M12MQ64,ITEM WAS JUST AS DESCRIBED GOOD QUALITY. I WOULD DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMEND.
R88GP82VWC8JW,Works well
R2WLPJ2IHA2G18,"Get new bolts, the ones in the kit are crap. The heads strip out very easily and if you tighten to much they shear off. The black coating comes off to easily. The directions are not helpful but it's not rocket science so 🤷‍♂️. It looks rustic but is cheaply made and for what I'm using it for it doesn't really matter. If I was putting it in my cabin I'd care a little more but it's for my garage. Advice: use a small hole saw in the corners and a saws all. My drum had insulation foam in it so I didnt need to worry about fumes, but I filled it with water to the top anyway."
RR8H4M6ZCP5EL,All came fully intact. No cracks or breaks. Packaging was impeccable!
R32Q3UGVE51YM9,Wife likes it
R3BBN89OW6VB6G,Good for price
R2OA4ZFH5PNEG5,"Great item, fixer my drove, running great, easy install."
R3GS0CZNMZX4PY,Great product
R1MFJIVX8FM5Q5,"This is a good little grate that fits nicely in our small wood stove. Confirming other reviews though, expect this to slowly warp from the heat (and we do keep our stove in the upper 200s to low 300s/350). Our first one only lasted one season.Overall, I still like it better than using bricks and haven't found a similar size alternative yet. Rating it 3 stars because I'd still buy it again."
R2VFNYY810P33B,Was an exact fit.
RD0N11GR04NZ4,This is the most important piece to add to the wood stove. It is simply amazing and works fantastic
R277LM22BL0YB4,Had to replace one on a chimney and this made it easy
R11QY7AC7IPKRZ,Good
RYZU2EA4MMGI1,Works great on my 55 gal even in Ca....
R2N7XAVTRY0KMM,I purchased this stove less than a year ago. The pressure switch broke and I am currently trying to get a replacement part. I have called the company 3 times! Each time they cannot find my information. I wouldn't purchase this product.
R2AZU5369009AM,It works
RGA0K15YTG41R,Fit my stove perfectly and they're very well made! I bought them a year ago and my stove puts out more heat since we've installed these. Will buy again!
R1ZC0Y8Y8SZJ6F,Was delivered damaged. Was not the shippers fault. Came encased in two boxes...no damage to either box. Unit housing was found to be bent....enough to not allow proper operation. I had to use a hammer and screw driver to straighten it out so the motor would spin. If it wasn't for the cold weather I probably would have shipped it back.1/11/2019 Update.....It self destructed last night at 3 AM....
R34IBZFVUBRLHR,This was a great replacement for our wood stove I will buy it again when needed.
R2654VA933KBLI,Most of the 12 we bought are crumbling after a week and a half of use. These have to be the worst fire brick we've ever purchased. We've replaced the fire brick in our wood furnace 3-4 times and all of the others we've used lasted at least 3 years. Total waste of money.
R3RHSYKZYUDH9A,Works like a charm blows air out very well runs very quiet would order again if needed
R2BRD3O68C49NY,This item was exactly as described; it is a bit on the smaller side but works perfectly for its intended purpose.Make sure to season it as you would anything case iron that will be holding water or getting wet.This hen is very happy atop a pellet stove in its new Vermont home!
R4GJAW2C5SHBZ,Nice replacement for stove. Product is holding up well for 2 winter seasons now
REHDTKSSIWNW8,Works good just wish could clean it
R1Z1ZBZ1E9KHKH,"Just what we needed. None were broken and they are helping our hearth operate properly in keeping our house warm. Packaging was superb. Above and beyond what we expected. Had to size a couple of the bricks so they would fit, but with a little filing they fit great."
R2V4JK430VMFM4,Nice heavy duty door.
R2WB1F703OLRGG,Fixed my stove right up
RTYA4R417PGUK,"Bought it November 16, broke by December 24. Lasted over a month. Ordered another, lets see how long it lasts.OK, bought a second one on December 25, Its January 25 and its broke again."
RLTEC7WK3EA81,First time I used it the center rod that runs through the plate straightened out from the heat from the wood stove and the spring pressure at one end of the damper.
R9WL5URPCWH1E,fit exactly as original. love it. stove running like new again
R2Y5VZ2RR9KOR1,Worked perfectly
R2W7L5XYIWNV7V,I had this on my Christmas wish list for a long time. Kindly someone purchased it for me. Sadly the black coating was chipped on the front and back. It also had a water line on the bottom (as pictured). I know the person who gave it to me does not have a wood stove and would never have done anything like test it out. I do not want to bother her gave me with returning it so I will keep it but it is disappointing. The item is not inexpensive. Too bad.
R2T2BZANKECYXD,Price
R1U05Y20N3HJ6B,If anyone is looking to use them in a forge do not buy them the one in my forge turned to glass on top an the heat is cracking and breaking
R1NZKLZX8GOA98,Built a nice backup heater
R3PW7CYOHY4CGG,It is just what it is.
R6GYYYB7W9247,"This is a very low quality part. Save your time and go to a hardware store for a better quality made in China Damper.It will not stay together and after taking the pipes apart twice, it went in the trash."
R3T98Q3Z55FVPB,Mom loves it sitting on her stove as adecoration and that’s all that maters.
R330MW229O3V89,Fit well
R19D36B6LST4YF,"Fits our furnace perfectly! Should've replaced the old ones sooner, as it has a much better draft now too."
REP6FSSIU1NPW,Broke as soon as I put a log in the stove
RQYB6OBULFQQO,"Bricks were very cheap.. The bricks I usually buy are much dencer. These bricks are veryporous, brittle and one came cracked."
RKL9RY3MAHXLD,"I bought this product because the advertisement says that it is durable and long lasting. The warranty says 1 year. A week before the 1 year was up, it quit working. The company would not honor the warranty because I was 4 days past the year warranty when I contacted them. My fault on that part because I was out of town and could not contact them until I got home to get the information to get a hold of them. They flat out just said the ""warranty has expired"".As far as when it did work, it did not push out hardly any heat. It is not worth buying, you would have better luck putting a small fan blowing into the area that you want heated. Very disappointed with this company not standing behind a defective product. I would think their reputation is more important then being 4 days past the warranty date."
RD0ONK4SC4625,"Fit as it should and heavy steel, its now 2-16-2020 and after 2 full seasons of burning, Living in iowa, burning 150 bags per season and still going strong. Maybe the bad reviews are install error. I use a cotter pin to attach it to the adjoining piece. That way the pin will break and not the end."
R3M3A6H739J2GL,Easily insulate 1500 and more.
R3OBSHPRWLHKGW,Got this as a gift for my son andhe loved it put ittogether easily and is one happy camper :-)
RK4MFGAN9E9ZV,"Seems to be well made, but no latch to keep the door from opening."
R1VI87AZ92I2ZQ,Hefty and the quality was great.
R2YYXXE8RQAFQN,Great
RMVB2QUC0N91E,installed it and it did not work. It was as bad as the one that I was replacing. it would not let the blower to the stove turn on! It it is just sitting here. I replaced it with a completely different mechanical unit.
R3U1VO0GZT34K,This is awesome!Better than expected.
R2IHMRSGB51CP6,This product is described as a steamer but the first time I filled it with water it rusted.How do you create steam without water?
R2PJRLUDS19MOP,I usefor my wood fire stove

R3R1K9QAQAXZXH,the stove will not heat the house all the way only keeps the room we are sitting in warm burn pot burned out and the burn box burned out and this is the second burn pot we have gone though so if you want to waste your money go right head they need to make the burn pots and and burn boxes out better material that will last not burn up so fast and the temp gauge hasn't worked for 6 months we spent a lot of money on that stove it
R1204MVCV8M126,great
RQGPU1BAGPEGH,Fit and install very easy after you get all the proper holes drilled.
ROR1CKZ9F6P53,"Is not sized properly. I'm having to resize the stove pipe so it will fit inside these brackets. The legs are cut at a strange angle, so much so that I welded the barrels to pipes for legs and just ignored these. Waste of money and time. Very frustrating."
R160GDM5EQHA7W,"Thought it would be a little bigger, holds a quart of water so I have to fill quite often through the day"
R3672NGARMEGCX,"I bought this steamer because one of the listed “Features and details” of this item was that it is manufactured in Canada. That is not true, the box says it was made in China."
RN0MJ6MQO71J0,This was the exact motor needed to get the pellet stove back in action.
RGG0PJ46C8JTE,Heavy and good quality chimney door!Easy to install and fits perfectly.
R2GSBFVNKI9KLH,good
R17OHU5HEQJ03,Great fit in my stove. But it was a little off color compared with the picture in the listing.
R18B0FQAP75PU9,Much better quality than I expected.The kit fit well.
R1TQNJSUIY32ZX,These Stoves are Great... But getting harder and harder to find/buy.... I am in the market looking to replace my old CAC Coal Circulator Heater.
R28HMIWQNQVBF2,fixed our stove
R1696YOJGNLBRV,Great for the price!
R2RO6D171ZLXC0,Had to replace ours of 28 years and this was very nice and came in timely manner
R1DY481V8ZJVEW,Fit well in our Regency #whatevermodel.
RNK3GAM1WUNFV,My pellet stove insert needed to be leveled.These worked great as shims and the hole was the exact size I needed for the fresh air intake hose.
R1IX0S6L8A9C67,works ok
R23EOSUXKOEWUT,Great product just as described
R2L9Y0JJLYJ1ZA,"This is an awesome product, works well and turns on when required."
R3AUVI8SDQV9UV,Replaces ac19 year old “heat robber”...works great
R23TKAWIQP0180,Product states return window has closed.I am no longer going to install.
R3400JY5U41YMR,Why the heck is this so expensive
R115HFJ8V74JG0,I have been cooking on cast iron since I was a kid and know the importance of seasoning it. But to take it right out of the box to find rust on a brand new product is disappointing. I am also disappointed in the fact that they did not check the product before sending it out. I contacted the seller and they did not respond. Would not recommend buying this. I could try sanding it down and reapplying a new coating but won’t be able to do it until it warms up.
R1PSZ0Y308SQKP,Couldn’t be happier with product.
R38X8OL5HYNPY0,So I've bought two (second was replenishment for #1 and I thought I was buying another brand so that was my fault. Anyway I installed per online instructions (none came with it) and what happened on first happened to second even sooner. So the center bar actually melts and bends so won't stay locked then the flap just flaps around and never secure.
R2AI32EC5DRS48,"Needed bricks to line my wood stove as It is my only source of heat but was way too hot and the wood burned out too fast. a pack of these and a pack of another brand were perfect together, My stove is working 100% as it should. Will purchase again in the spring to make a fire outdoors. Still have a lot of Rutland Refractory Cement left."
RXVMJ044KAYB1,Easy to install. Just had to have plumbing ran to it. Anything that helps save money in the long run I'm all for it.
R2TI57JNBRIZ9U,Decent material and it works great. Giving 2 starts because they don’t put the 3 in section of pipe you need to connect the top barrel.
R2ULQC8HP71N5Y,ok
R2J3L984971XJ,"Was the right size as stated in ad, will be returning"
R1QSLP4PGX15Q8,"Cheap price, well built"
R3SPLRMP3UMP8Q,Great
R34DF2BPZABPTM,"Update 11/29/2019Started having real issues with smoke coming outof the fuel preheat chamber. The area between the hopper and the burn basket.Today the stove couldn’t get the chimney thermometer above 300 even with the hot burning Red Fir pellets. It could only raise the temp in the yurt from 15F to 57F (-10C to 10C), and smoked the place out so badly I had to keep opening the door to air the yurt out. Nothing I did helped stop the smoke from backing up the burn basket towards the hopper.Hauled the stove outside and gave it a thorough washing with hot soapy water from the chimney pipe down, but just didn’t see much soot coming out.While drying the path for the pellets, specifically where the pellets sit above the burn basket, I turned my hand up and was surprised.The 4” space above the burn basket (place circled in yellow) to just below where the pellets start the straight drop down was PACKED with clinker like carbon. +50% of that space was clogged almost the entire 4” of that space.With a two inch by half inch piece of scrap metal I was able to scrape open up that square tube so it was a good 85% clear up and around. It took a good half hour.It’s a really awkward place to get your meat hooks into, and the carbon material will eat your skin like a belt sander with 24 grit. But I managed to get a good cup, cup and a half, of crap out of there.Still love the stove. Will build a locking swivel scraper so I can properly clean that spot in future. Definitely the Achilles heel of cleaning maintenance on this stove.If you’re stove starts losing heat and smoking out the hopper and/or pre-heatingchamber, check that 4” section above the burn basket! You may be really glad you did.Using a rubber mallet, I gave that section percussive maintenance about every half hour for the firstthree hours after relighting.After the first 45 minutes or so, the chimney temp started staying between 460 and 500, and pellet area stopped smoking.As the temps outside have dropped into the low 20’s, the temps inside have climbed up to 70F and seem to be staying there.Hopefully this did the trick and the casa will be warmer than 50F in the morning!Update 12/7/2018Installed the proper air intake after temperatures dropped to 11F.Vacuuming out the entire burn chamber area and chimney after installing the air intake hose, I’m having good issues- issues keeping the inside cooler than 50F warmer than outside.Still a one bag a day stove no matter what the outside temperature.Important to keep the fly ash vacuumed out a few times a week.Burn basket still looking good.————Pros:Unit arrived in great shape.Assembly was far easier than instruction manual. 2/3 of the assembly was already done (thermometer installed etcFor running continuous, I’ve found the following tricks.Burn a bag or two of several different brands before stockpiling for winter. I found some brands either don’t feed because they’re too “sticky” (just won’t slide on their own), or there too long to feed well.Before bed, and first thing in the morning:Shake the burn chamber well (I use a rubber mallet and whack it on the sides).Even out ash layer in ash tray.Clean secondary burn chamber.Empty ash tray.Top off the hopper before going to sleep.I pull burn chamber apart about once a week and vacuum the while thing, and pick off any residue on the burn basket.Temps have been dipping in the mid 20’s F. Stove has kept the yurt in the high 60’s to around 73F.On low burn I’ve been using about one bag of pellets every 24-30 hours.Nice to know:Burn off the new stove stink before putting in the place.Use a chimney when burning off the stink, or you can’t get it hot enough.Cons:If you don’t even out the pellets when the hopper is nearly empty, the hopper will fill with smoke.If you shut off pellets and let the stove burn off the last in the chamber while set for low temperatures, winds can blow the smoke inside.Overall:Awesome to have a warm yurt 24x7If this keeps up and the burn basket survives the winter I’ll probably bump this up to 5 stars."
R34ASYLELEJLJP,The unit was a direct replacement for the original. It actually seems like a little better quality than the original equipment.From start to finish it took about 15 minutes to replace. Unplug the stove. Take off the back cover. Remove the four screws that hold the blower in place. Disconnect the two wires. Then reverse the process. It's about as easy as a repair can get.
RUTV9LWPGQGLL,"UPDATE, 3rd year, no problems.I have the side control panel model, built 2012 and I bought it used in 2017, I am happy with mine. No problems so far. I just start it up on low and let it go. To start it I fill the burn pot with 1/2 cup of pellets bunched up around the ignitor and leave the hopper door open until the flame dies down. The auto start is great but feeds in to many pellets in my opinion.I always let it run at the lowest setting. I find that I have to adjust the, inside the cabinet, intake air lever to control flame height a bit and for one brand of pellets even had to close off half the intake air pipe with duct tape to get a decent burn. I wish they made a pellet stove with all manual control instead of computer. I clean the burn pot every other day when in constant use and the bottom ash pan once a month. The fan is loud but I don't have it in the tv room and I'm warm so who cares. Uses about a bag a day. Based on my experience I would buy another. I feel sad for those having problems but these things are not just push a button and walk away. You do need to watch andadjust for a good burn rate with different pellet brands. Sometimes after many hours of burning a red hot glowing glom builds up in the burn pot so I open the door and break it up with a long handle knife while it's running ( you get 30 seconds to get the door closed before it goes into shutdown) . Uses 300-400 watts during initial startup then 125 watts per hour from then on."
R3DV9VMIHTFXRG,Perfect size exactly what I wanted
R29PO07HO5W1IM,WILL WORK GOOD FOR MY OLDER WOOD STOVE-THANK YOU.
R1MFTJA3L1TO0F,"It has to be refilled twice a day but to me that's worth it for the fact of what a great piece it is. Quality is great, everyone's compliments it and the price is so low company to similar products. It goes perfect with my country decor. I love it."
R2A4T0KEZBI5DC,Got these parts that where double wrapped and heavier than I thought they would be. Fit in the stove perfectly!
R1TXDXSBI3Z9ZV,That it is easy to put in!!
ROKPFK7BKAF4V,"Arrived in 2 days, was easy to install!"
RJX8ZZ39M03ZA,"We purchased the product and have been struggling with it for 4 years.US Stove company support was no help.They offered no productive advice and while we called several times, replaced everything from the blower motor to the computer itself and all the switches, the unit has been a complete waste of our money.I cannot stress enough how little US Stove did to support us.There was more concern on wherewe bought it than any expressed concern in solving our problem."
R1VEMIFOS9F2ZO,Part came on time. And fit perfectly
R1K0M22U83N7QB,We did have to order 2 boxes. Count how many you have before
R2S1VOQEQQLVXE,This came very quickly and works great
R19Y765VKJBE4O,Worked great easy to follow instructions
R26J21SECJ7EYN,This piece was bought to replace a grate in our wood stove. Our daughter have us the stove 2 years ago but it needed new grates. It works like a new thousand dollar stove.
R1IGT6CJU1KF4,"These bricks claim to be able to withstand 2000 degrees, but lasted less than two hours at 1600-1700. They're also extremely brittle with one breaking when it fell 3 feet onto sand."
R3UV7TL2TZ5HCJ,We love it
RTV77WXGQ7QSX,Well made
R2GG4OIREQMFR5,"Perfect fit for a Clayton stove, I personally think it is better quality than the original with a lot lower price than anywhere else I could find."

R2MAERWV319WO5,I purchased 5 boxes and out of 30 bricks only 7 arrived whole. Sending them back!
R37P3UTQ6FVHOZ,Good
R3S52AATBRCV7B,Heat in garage and burning paper work
R30I1I38EENG61,"I got mine used so it was a great price. For those complaining about rust. It is cast iron. It needs to be treated properly. If you don't know how to use cast iron it will rust on you. It steams well, is a little small but very cute and I can drop essential oils in it too."
R2OCARBRB93YBZ,The grate fit perfect!!It was easy to remove the old one and install the new one!
RVCW8Q1HVHCHW,Very very pleased with the quality!It felt way more heavy duty then the ones I’ve bought locally. Hope it lasts.
RR9DC0P1K3252,Purchased as a gift. Reciepent loved it. A must for “chicken” collectors!
R8KNVGSSOATWS,I had ordered one which didnt work. I sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one. Thank you amazon but the second one was bad too.Guess I eat the 400 bucks
RQLTD044H25YM,works well.only issue is that the pins for the door hinge were missing.....I suspect that they fell out of the hole in the box that was created from the door rubbing a hole in the cardboard during shipping.....no biggy… a 16penny nail will do the trick
RMM6O6YF51VEY,Great
R35ZQG86EGMFZA,It was the exactsame one workinggreat
R1ZS549MMOJYT2,Work well for replacement
RATV9DO2DNS5D,One firebrick broke in half the first time I started a fire............

R3ETU3XWMML69G,Welds were sloppy with a lot of slag on the main shaft.
R1J7DCU3K6V1NX,It’s is axactly what they said it would be and works like the original that came with the stove
R1HZPVG472PX3X,Welding small objects
R2TMZUZKPZ2AOH,"Used these as a base, put fire ring on top and then mortared stones from the property. Fire bricks were light, came intact and quickly. Have held up to a few fires already. We are happy with them"
RVNUYCSIFIE6K,It didn't fix to good but I going to keep it
R2LZA9741JX9KX,Beltless still before building another like product
RL6FBON37XKAW,This thing is great! Pretty easy to install and these stoves put out some serious heat!
R2RT04WK3T8RKJ,"You do plug it in,when the woodstove gets hot enough then it starts blowing it out into the room,so are your precious heat doesn’t go up the chimney!"
R2GN4CFQ70TL1K,"This box does not fit an ashley 24af.... In Fact it's no where even close... I expected a filter box that's made by the manufactor of the furnace would at least get it close... Whatever the hell you guys are smoking at ussc I want some!.... Its a good thing I do a lot of hvac work for a living so I'll make it work for if i couldn't I would send it back smashed up the best I could with a sledge hammer, so anyways thanks for next to nothing, 1st and last thing I'll ever buy from u people"
R31YSD066SYDQA,did not lightyou have to break it up sucks!!!!
RJFLVP4R856EV,Perfect! Used it in my kitchen. Could of used it in the living room as well
R9USQKQL5ZEQU,"It's what it says it is. But required extra bolts and hardware. I'm not sure where the BTU rating came from. Mine never achieved more than about 600 btu. If anything I would remove any btu info, use stainless steel bolts, and provide enough bolts and nuts to get the job done."
R3SOX4C2UGXHTS,"good delivery ,good product"
R10HVU5DM7YIAN,Very nice quality!
R27DFYHFYR7QJJ,Not happy. All I received was a door to the stove. No barrel
R17QF9BZ4S8U1W,"I had several of these going back to the $99 days, it's the cheapest on the market.1st off, take the damper out of the top of the stove and put it inside the pipe about 30inches from the stove., You'll get much better draft and it heats that pipe and heats faster / better.2nd, always crack the damper a bit when adding wood, that'll suck in any smoke.3. I leave the 1sttop round plate off ( near the large door) and everything closed up with a small fire in the rear of the stove and it works great., it's sucks air above the fire, not through it...and it smolders and heats the room, throw a punky ( wet ) log in there with a little dry at night and it'll last 8 hours.It's a great little stove but you must learn how to work it."
RZ3VITZVVLNM0,Heavier quality than you would expect for this price
R1J9A4HGJKDD2U,My husband made an awesome barrel stove with this kit- love it!
R2FDV0XQPWDCXN,Well built. Dimensions were exactly as advertised
R10UTBRV20TO3U,Keeps the shop toasty.
RY4TW8VJQD08H,"I owned this little stove a LONG time ago when I had a School Bus converted to an RV. When I installed it the thing would smoke out the front when I opened the door. The issue was the ""Plate"" in the top of the stove! Just remove it and use a damper in the flu. Problem solved... No worries, this will not affect the operation of the stove. However, use a spark arrestor on the top cap. Basically a screen around the inside of the cap to stop the sparks. Duh. It heats a big area but requires fuel often because of it's size."
R3GMZ4VL13OB3Z,"I didn't care for the hardware, and there was no handle included to open it with, had to use a bolt... i suppose it serves its purpose though."
R3OE7BP5OB2R2P,Great for the price!
R3KAX2MKL5UD5E,Will be nice heat in barn
RSGP0WL5WCRBS,Liked very much!
R1OGV0WWZ5DF58,"Holding up well, cheapest model. Would buy again."
R1UN7UM06H3DI5,"Fairly easy to put together. Some minor confusion with parts/directions, but with some common sense everything comes together nicely. Great product for the money."
R3EXCEG4WUIVMH,Really nice kit. Comes with a damper which I did not know which is a big bonus. I have a U.S. stove furnace and it's fabulous. Very pleased!
R3N46CWX4CBOKK,"Works as an outside stove. It was fairly easy to install. Tested once and found what other reviewers have said about the air inlet at the bottom of the door not letting in enough air is true. If I closed the door with vent fully open the blazing fire will go out. I will be only using it outside so I'll just leave the door open. It will arrive very poorly packaged, so open yours right away to check all parts to see if they are still there and all are undamaged. The first kit I returned because the door was cracked. The second one I put together but found two nuts were missing."
R1KK1W2J93PD5L,works good
R2AXAV6EI4B7HS,works good
R2RMX4HP0KA00P,Item arrived in an opened and damaged box. The bolts and additional pieces were loose and floating around inside of damaged original box.
R1FP87IZVOLLMR,Did the job.
R34JIRZ6VJAIR5,This was the 2nd stove we received. 1st one was busted when we received it. 2nd stove looked exactly like tge 1st one. Same parts busted. Returned it and cancelled order.
R2Y4TIHDRYHDDU,"Today Philthy reViews....bricks......Worth the Buy?I can't honestly say it had any bearing on my heat retention for the smoker at all.So I cannot truly recommend the buy.I was initially hoping these would help my smoker retain the heat for long smokes and free up my time instead of tending to the charcoals, wood, etc.But with two brisket back to back smokes this weekend, I think it does not really aid in keeping the heat inside the smoker.This was obvious on how quickly the temp drops, etc.Your mileage may vary."
R2YGRDVRCCLESC,"Great item ,just as described dropped right in excellent quality I have one season in it so far"
R23Z6B70E6Q2EW,"I bought two to fit in my pizza oven, perfect fit well built grates"
RV5ZQAZQN7O6C,"Great kit for a diy, but watch the bolts and nuts bc the do strip. The only issue i had is the door hinges break pretty easy after it fell off the counter while trying to install."
R23TY63T5M59IX,Very glossy but ok otherwise
R2X0CE0UM6NXO4,I lined the bottom of my aging zero clearance fireplace with these.Easy to cut to size on a table saw with diamond blade.
R2M189V16E8W1U,So far has been a perfect replacement for the original grill that melted during an overfire
R25GM609S5MWTK,Great replacement part.
R1NLL661Q8N0X3,Perfect fit for my stove. Went through winter just fine. I would buy this again.
R14XADHD9XZDWV,"Purchased twice, excellent product"
R3V15BSBX4WQ27,Very durable
R20QC5SOOISQO5,"Looks great, works great very happy with the purchase"
RXH0U9A4G3J5L,"Worked good on our 16x20 tent during our hunting trip. Didn't have adequate ventilation so I had to use the 2'' bung for added air flow. Wish I would have bought two... to use the second ones door frame only, to sandwich two door frames together to avoid the warp sheet metal from the drum."
R2TYLP78TBDH5W,"The quality of this item is great.... solid cast iron. However, the product package box was completely destroyed inside of an amazon shipping box that was completely intact. When unboxing, all of the mounting hardware was scattered throughout the box and we are missing 2 bolts. My biggest issue is that our package DID NOT include the Flue Collar. Not sure if I am able to order one separately, but nonetheless, it was supposed to be included and wasn’t."
RMNR4IHVIFX2S,Husband heats his shop with wood.Device works well dispensingheat.Would have given it 5 stars but it is a bit noisy.
RR51T8KHK6JH,"These baffles are made from ""cheap steel"", you probably already know this if your even considering ordering this Baffle.I'm tossing the entire stove in the ""scrap pile"" because the Baffles keep warping and the US Stove does not draw properly allowing smoke into the house.I have used wood stoves throughout my life, don't burn wet or green wood, etc.US Stove should be ashamed to sell this dangerous Wood Stove.Photos of the warping and bent Baffle are attached.A little difficult to see but long story short this is the second Baffle in the stove, discovered the first bent Baffle when I was cleaning the stove. Second one bent so bad I cannot remove it from the stove without a torch to cut it.I contacted US Stove via email and calling customer service and never received a reply despite repeated attempts to contact them."
RFKZI7K9GZPO0,"It was exactly as described, and arrived quickly!"

R3LHES8ABVA2OJ,Works as it shouldbut can't use in my garage due to insurance stipulations
RAJJDXQK77VHX,"It's good, had a little problem with the damper, fixed myself. Built the stove but have not used it yet so can't speak to longevity. It feels heavy, like it's built well."
R19IV1W790Y3VP,I would not recommend this kit to anyone.I put it together for my garage.It does not vent out the chimney and fills my garage with smoke everytime. The flue sticks had to knock it into the barrel to alleviate some of the smoke issue. I am very disappointed.
R1VUFXS0KR5RIV,As described
R29BRDW6FEG4AZ,"Perfect replacement, got here quickly."
R3NFR4LHOXYD7V,It was all broken when I received it.I got busy and never returned it on time.
R1DF7HUEX4SFCO,"Purchased this past fall to use in our wood burning stove. After two fires the grate had already completely cracked through in one spot on the edge, and several more cracks showed up over the course of the winter. As we continued to use the grate the metal also began to flake off in layers. We will be throwing it out and purchasing another one from a local shop specializing in wood stoves and fireplaces before next winter arrives. It managed to get us through the winter, which is the only reason I didn't give it one star."
RQL2DC8T2IU8E,great
R35VO256PDH787,"The outside chimney clean outdoor rusted immediately, first amazon product i have been disappointed in. you should not sell this product, andi would like another one or total refund"
R1GUFHHHIC61JK,"It starts easily and seems to burn OK.I am using a 3"" x 3' riser to my existing 6"" chimney.Have some draft problems with low burning temperatures.I am going to install a vacustack cap to take care of this problem.I have never had a pellet stove before and I plan on trying different brands to get it right.The stuff the store gave me has 1% ash, US Stove says 1/2% is best, now I have to find some.The gravity feed system takes some getting use to, try not to poke and prod."
R3PH06OM1YPAX9,"I've got 3 of these. Greenhouse use, every day. Great.Amazon keeps asking for reviews. I almost Never have an internet connection here, (rural)Don't accept lack of response as negative, it's hard to get through."
R2XDUVXNNEG5O8,first kit came with broken leg second come with broken dampener. had to put both kits togeather to make one good kit then ship the broken stuff back as one kit. works good if it doesn't come broken

R2OS1E1P2JXROU,"Haven't gotten to put it all together yet, will wait for warmer weather...but, the stuff is HEAVY...the poor postal gal had a bit of a time with it...should last longer than the drum will. And will work better for syrup production than a turkey fryer base and propane..."

RMWNSXWQ0C042,Door hinge broke during assembly :(
R2D8U50INMFNSA,It is Very Small....
R2KGXAEM5SFYAX,Simple and straight forward installation. All parts fit well and snuggly.I do suggest using furnace cement between the barrel and the front door/flue. This will make a tight seal so no smoke make a it's way out places it isn't supposed to.
R2TX5P7TSRV9U,Expected larger size
R34FN3RZHMGLSB,Exactly what we have been looking for to replace broken ones in our wood burning fireplace/stove.
RR1ZZ1U9LG2MB,Door doesn't latch. There is nothing to keep this door from blowing open with a gust of wind down the chimney.

RR79ZN2T2VL5V,the thing is not long enough for the pot I would say it was 6 inches short of what it is it not going to do the job i tryed hooking it up with one hole it will not do the job it is junk to me and they mislead you when your looking tell you it is for us stove 8500 bull
R36XQOAA1QH839,fits fine and works great.Be careful to drill holes in the pipe 180 degrees so it will rotate inside the pipe.
R23RU97WGU9UYU,Thermostat went out but I rewired it to a switch in the wall so I can turn it on and off want too. Works much better this way. Fan is very quiet. I would buy this product again but would rewire it before I put it up.
R17QOEE6WWJQGL,GREAT A+
R3CH5AY2I34QPY,GREAT A+
RN4J4EGME3ZU0,"Made In CHINA...They need to hire American engineers!(Six inch stove pipe does not fit)! The hole is 6 and 1/4 inch. The pipe is suppose to go on the outer side, not the inside. Inside you'll have a room full of smoke! (Six inch stove pipe does not fit)!!! JUNK! Don't know why they took it off my order list?"
RNC7TYKS6AOCL,Great deal fast ship
R2UPYOS5Z7X2O8,"The order arrived on time and in my mailbox, 5 star. However, after installing the new switch, the blowers run when switch and wood burner are at room temp, no fire burning. Because I was planning ahead, I purchased 2 switches. Switch # 2, behaves same as #1. Strange at best. I broke out my Ohm meter to check, cold switch is closed power flowing, warm w bic lighter, switch opens, no power flow. They are working backwards???Makes no sense to me. Need to return. I welcome some feedback.Update: After speaking w US Stove Co, it is determined that the switches sent to me are Hi limit switches labeled as Low limit on package.Replacement on way from Amazon we'll see, thanks, also from US Stove Customer service/Technical Dept., a Huge Thank You for figuring out problem and sending out the correct switches for sure. New switches arrived Monday 3-12. Correct switches, furnace working again. Thank you."
RBBB9DC573YUK,Works good
R2VCTOGFI534DL,Good product and great to have them shipped right to the house.
RAXDEN4W513XK,Easy installation .works great . Not easy to clean .
R2QEDH3J4QA1QU,Perfect fit
R3GTU55M68XF7,Great productShipped quickly as always
R4PI8LFYBZG8C,Nice kit. Easy install. Kept my shop toasty warm this winter. Will last forever. One of the pins was missing in the door hinge so I just put a carter pin in it. No big deal. I put it up on blocks so it was 24 inches off the ground for easy use and cleaning.
R23CN8KN76I154,Worked fine
R3HBGBH4NK542Z,Garbage they melted halfway through within a week
R1PHYJ6ODWH4LR,How quickly I received it and how easy the installation was .
REE9LU377PBFS,Good product. Fast delivery and good quality
RB55PNFMZTBRA,Had it about 6 months.It is just as loud as the one I took off.Was very quiet for the first few months.Apparently not as good of quality as the original one that was new in 2006.
RLEHB0X1082RB,Fit great
RR420OGOK3F5P,Barrel spacers should have been named sort of fit.Did not fit the curvature of the top barrel as well as it should.Big gap.Also if you don't have barrels with removable lids then you will need self starting metal screws like used on metal buildings.The nuts and bolts supplied are uselessin this case.
R2J0I9ISWJB218,"Not happy at all. These firebricks started to break they day before they couldn’t be returned and now all but one of the 6, that we used there is one that’s still in the box. I wouldn’t tell anyone to buy Them they are garbage i wish we could get our money back or new ones"
R3RQLQ1A1V0S6O,Smaller than I thought it be.
R19NRMOLT2MPDJ,"It works, but the vents are a joke on it. They need to be bigger. You have to open the door to get more airflow...and yes barrel stoves are a pain to vent good...but if these vents were bigger it would do better, but it works!"
R1APFOGA6KAZOV,"Works well. Got all pieces undamaged. They sent extra nuts and bolts. The only complaint is the radiuses on feet don't match radius of 55 gallon barrel. but other than that, very happy"
R1MH156BOX1OL3,"Works well. Got all pieces undamaged. They sent extra nuts and bolts. The only complaint is the radiuses on feet don't match radius of 55 gallon barrel. but other than that, very happy"
R1RHSHEBR5BMQV,Door doesnt look cheap. Quality parts.
R24ZRL93GBIOA6,great product
R3HGMSINJ5SHUO,Great product. The shorter height allows it to fit on top of the wood stove in the fireplace. Many others were too tall. Only needs filled every few days.
R1Z1H8XHPVX67J,"I thought I was getting 2 parts, a front and rear as the add indicated. I only got one piece"
R3F50ASRVGBVI6,I bought this because the price of the larger cast iron steamers was way too much. It works and looks great but because wood is our primary source of heat in the winter it needs filling once or twice a day and for the sake of my poor memory I wish I had something that held more water. Would be a good product for stoves not used as frequently as ours.
R7MN5H139436T,"Really nice cast iron, solid and heavy"
R7Z53YWP1SX3X,The motor worked perfectly and fit as well. Also the price was the best of all. Thanks for your top notch service.
R1ZC5FE2UXP0I1,Works perfect! Received it quickly!
R1IW3Y213MP83,The blower is working with know problems.Fit the opening as original did.
R23R4D3R2CQ8KJ,loved it
RBI7NDKAV8N4G,Working great!
R3U7EM5ISU88A0,Great product. hopefully will save $$$$$.
R6YTL9ET1LK3T,Like it all! It fit my stove perfectly.
RJUYC62B6Y330,Total P.O.S. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. It bowed in the middle after the first day. I had to put steel supports under the middle or I'm sure it would have sagged to the bottom of the stove. Every day when I clean the ashes from the stove I can see that it is deteriorating a little bit. It already has several cracks in it and I'm sure that soon it will be in the junk barrel.This China made piece of crap would be overpriced if it sold for $2.99. What a disappointment and total waste of money. I should of went out and had a steak and a couple of beers instead of wasting money on this P.O.S. I purchased this P.O.S. on 1/3/2018 and today is 2/12/2018. NEVER AGAIN!!!
R3FV400LRLZAST,"Part was to satisfaction,fast delivery."
R15U6ZCDT4WQ8G,"Location:SoCal Mountains @ 8,225 ft.Typical winter low temps around 15 deg at night.Using this stove in an insulated 24 foot Yurt.At this elevation, we have had many issues with using propane or kerosene.Setup and assembly was simple.Instructions are written well and easy to understand.After many months, this stove works exactly as advertised.This stove isn't for everyone.This stove is very simple to use, but you will have to clean it every couple of days to keep up it's efficiency.I am using Douglas Fir pellets as per the instructions and getting around 18 hours out of a 40 lb bag.I am using a 3-4 reducer, 90 deg elbow, 24 inches of 4"" double wall, 90 deg elbow, 60 inches of 4"" double wall with no draft problems.Also, I plumbed a 3 inch fresh air intake as per instructions.I am able to get this up to temp (600 deg) in less than 20 minutes.Once it gets going, there is very little to maintain.I shake the secondary burn chamber about every 6 hours or so and that is it, it just keeps working.I don't have to add wood every few hours.Ash?, I get about 2-3 shot glasses of very fine ash from a 40 lb bag.After burning for about 48 hours, it will need to be shutdown (takes a couple of hours) for cleaning the fly ash out of the main burn tunnel.Cleaning only takes a few minutes and you can fire it right back up.I do not have electricity at this location.Wood is a pain, cutting/splitting etc.I was fully aware of burn basket replacement every year or two and all the other little nuances.This is an awesome stove for me.I love the ease of use and amount of heat output.Operating cost for me is a fraction of the price than operating with kerosene......and I am not cold anymore.31Jan2018- 10:00pm:Temp 19 Deg wind 10-15 mph.Inside temp steady all night at 65-68 deg."
R23QW0X39RGQLQ,"Blowers are as advertised, fit and work well.I am satisfied with purchase......Thank You!"
RA434IQBKII5X,Just what was needed to stop the fan motor from turning on/off repeatedly. Great price!
R2U4RGLQ4EZHIY,I would recommend this item.
RU70VKXPVHFV5,"This is a great little steamer chicken pot.A Note to those who read that it rusts after use - YES. It's cast iron. Iron rusts unless you protect it.We protect it by seasoning it and this creates a barrier so that the water doesn't encourage rust. You have to season this chicken steamer like you season a cast iron pan.Here's how to season it easy: Build a big fire in your wood stove, put 2 layers of good aluminum foil down on top (only the size of the chicken and it's lid separately), take a pastry brush and put a thin scrim of cooking oil all over the inside of the chicken pot, and the underside of the lid. Put the pot, either upside down or right side up, on top of the foil on top of the wood stove with the raging fire in it. Leave it there for a good long burn or two. The heat will season the cooking oil to the cast iron. Voila - no more rusting.I have had this little chicken for months, and have had no rust. And we fill it every day.Hint: Put some whole cloves, bay leaves, or any kind of hydrosol in it to make you house smell mildly herbal and lovely. I also dehydrate orange, lemon and lime rinds and throw them in there - gives it a good citrus kick."
R19RBRRWEV5H90,"Made in China but is better quality than some I've seen, will definitely do the job."
R3SB1MZS2B2KAY,Excellent for the stove.
R23VFTJPANQDUE,"read the ad .... it is to work with your existing barrel stove. You get top kit , not full kit with bottom legs and door. Kit will provide extra heat and better wood use."
R2G5HXLREF2ORO,Bought 6041i pellet stove insert oct.2017 installedJan.2018 working just fine burns hot hardly any ash replaced 1990 Blackwell that was still working hope this one last as long.
R2SJLK7PPL4OR7,Great service and product.
ROF18AUVEBJLT,just what I needed!
RG0S5NLZ9DRES,"I bought this grate because I had a hard time starting fires in our small-ish high efficiency fireplace.I was looking for something as small and especially as low as possible.This grate fit the bill.It is pretty heavy but also very compact and low.I can fit some rolled up cardboard under it to help start the fire and the extra air circulation from below really helps getting a fire going in no time.I'm very happy with it, and it has made a huge difference in getting fires going.I have now had it for something like 1.5 winter seasons.We use it nearly every day from November until February/March. Just recently I noticed that it started bowing a little bit in the center. (See pictures). I'm not sure if the manufacturer reads this, but if so, I think a little foot on each side in the center would fix this problem.I never really clean this grate.It gets warm in the morning when we start the fire and slowly cools down at night when we let the fire go out.So, as a summary, yeah, this is great, but I do wish it was made of slightly better material (or at least had center feet) so that it wouldn't start bowing in the center.I have a feeling that in a year or so it will probably be touching the bottom.Unfortunately this seems to be the only grate of this size, so I would probably buy it again.I will try to report back if there are any changes."
R34BL3CTUJ6PI0,"I have one of the originals made in White City Oregon It works great, one of my better investments"
R3LH36DAJLD19O,Well made and long lasting
R199D52V2UCCPU,"We live in NH. We bought the larger model of this stove from the Home Depot. Operation and maintenance are the same, this smaller unit just doesn't put out the heat that the larger one does. We have a 1980 square foot Victorian. The house has been insulated. We chose this stove because it is one of the few rocket stove pellet burners on the market. We wanted supplemental heat that wasn't dependent on electricity as we were replacing our woodstove for insurance reasons. We run the pellet chimney into a straight up 6 inch stainless Steel lined 30' chimney. Draft isn't an issue and there is no smoke visible from the Chimney even on cold days.Set up was easy. I uncrated and assembled in a few minutes with basic hand tools. I light mine with a standard propane torche but use Mapp Gas. 1 canister per ton and a half or so. We have burned 2 ton of pellets of a variety of brands all softwood/hardwood blend.I like the simplicity and relative clean operation. Compared to wood. However this unit is not maintenance free. It will burn hottest when clean, after a bag or two of pellets (80lbs) you will need to clean it to operate above 500 degrees. It burns about 12 hrs on a bag nothing close to 30 or 36. Maybe more of you open it up on slow burn but you won't get the heat you desire.Creosote will build up and ""glaze"" the fire box. This appears after every burn and will require scraping with a stiff scraper. I use a wire brush as well. You will need an ash or shop vac. You will need to clean it regularly and you will have black hands and it is messy. In many ways much more involved than a woodstove clean out.Ash travels all the way up to the top of the unit and requires full vacuuming. The chimney angles of the burn chamber are too sharp angled for even flexible brush rods to reach. I've even tried cable wire and not had any luck. The center tube is impossible to clean, I blow and vacuum mine out but I have no way of knowing if it's clearIt's my opinion this is the single greatest flaw and if the stove manufacturer ever updates this design, a second window or access door needs to be added and or a secondary ash collection tube should ride below for the ash to drop into. Design with clean out in mind... the inventor You Tube Video shows him water hosing it out to clean... that might work in California, but in places where it's below freezing your not going to hose it out during the season.Also the pellet burn basket will not stand up to more than one season without coming unwelded. I can weld, so building additional baskets and or fixing this one isn't a big deal but would be for your average homeowner.You will want ceiling fans or stand up fans to move the air around the house."
ROD8SJ8CN3YCW,Direct replacement for my USS 6039
R1SH67H2PCTNO,Good product good price
R1CCZCSYOI94DS,The grate is as expected second we ordered in the last couple years.
R1YNKOB1L4OEYY,Great do-it-yourself kit!
R2GRM7UE2YDKIH,It is not as sturdy as the original. Harder to clean soot off of it.
RFFRYDXNVRGPM,can't believe the previous owner burned expensive firewood w/o out it!
R2VZM4O3YRU2BB,1100sq ft ranch in new england. Heats living room to about 70 and bedrooms stay about 60. In 5 years I've replaced the exhaust blower once and had to replace the burn pot once. The burn pot does overflow. I clean it before bed and in the morning. I can get about 8-12 hours before it overflows. That's what ruined the burn pot though. Overheating warped it to the point I couldn't straighten it out anymore. I have tried many different blends of pellets but there doesnt seem tk be much difference inthe way this stive burns them. I have noticed i get the longest burn time with stove chow pelletsfrom home depot. All in all it does what I intended. I couldn't afford one of the better pellet stoves out there but it works. I would give it 4 stars if it didn't need the burn pot cleaned so often and then 5 if it wasn't made in China.
R2Y2578S318MXS,"Seriously? ""Miracle heat""??? Okay, it does capture a little extra heat off the flu pipe, but I'd hardly call it a miracle.It tends to vibrate an buzz a little more than I'd like, but other than that, It seems to be okay."
R2OOUQE1K7MA70,Works good for my stove usstove 6041
R21SPEBMOQDPGX,all good
R16DOEH3TVJRKI,"Works great, bought the double barrel kit and everything worked great."
R3K1Z7J2ZD3F98,Totally impressed!
R1VDN3BV7AMWC,"The ""feet"" on the legs that attach to the barrell were at such a sharp angle that I had to have the metal shaved off in order for them to fit squarely on the barrell."
R2DT5A95IK99SW,Good idea
R357W46NNNVJ0P,"I love this chicken steamer! It fits perfectly on our wood stove insert which only has a 6"" surface, so the smaller size of this is just right. The chicken itself is really pretty and I like that the tail feathers are where the steam comes out.We get a lot of comments on it, and it works really well.There is some rust inside like every other one I've ever had, totally normal and acceptable levels for the amount we are using it.Cute design and actually works effectively."
R3FIFXY1GXRP66,Works good and sturdy
RN7UN53SSYIX7,I miss a flue collar & Damper in my order
R28VR9JUIH72CU,Exactly correct part
R304LRG27523K8,just the right parts
R29X92OOCKD93O,"I just stick a couple of these in my woodstove. They retain and reflect heat ling after the fire burns out, which means I don't need to keep getting up to toss on another log! Also, a couple on top likewise remain hot, and I set my coffee potthere. Arrived with corners a bit broken, no biggie."
R1W1CL92INDK4E,Its a byob kit. Bring your own barrel
R2TARN4NXKBK6O,"The stacking brackets absolutely suck, where you bolt them to the barrel they do not concave properly and they are angled, you would be better off welding angle iron between the upper and lower barrel , I only give it 2 stars because they do support the top barrel"
R3B60ZN4ARWSO2,I purchased to replace in my Whitfield stove. Match’s the picture perfectly. It was very easy to install. Very quiet can’t even hear it run.Perfect thank you so much!!
R1CUGM6HYDPD4F,Product was fine however the package came very damaged
R1X3380PZ0R02B,this does not come with a barrel nor should it but some do actulay think they are getting the 55 gallion drum wow but this KIT is fine barrels put out the heat love them K.I.S.S keep it simple stupid works best in many cases and this is one of them
R18PR9136NL2RB,Fit perfect!
R2R2R4JLVHVIYH,Decent quality easy job
R3LNV98NFI5CQ5,Amazing product. Works perfectly. And easy to assemble.
R2JC36F539QF0Q, I have had this running for 2 weeks and it started off very quite. Now it rattles so badly it’s annoying to sit by the wood stove now. Very disappointed.
R1X4TDG2VB023R,"Very low quality, very disappointed.I bought this as a Christmas gift.I was embarrassed!!"
R2T7KWWNUFAQ4R,Showed up broken.Directions are very vague and NO illustrations.Do not buy.
R1DOLBRUOIB0WF,This was our first Amazon purchase. Never installed it (or the wood burning stove we bought it for) but it went with the stove when I sold it at a nice profit. I don't regret buying the Damper. It was nicely crafted.
R3QTKLEB29WI7T,"This holds about 3 cups of water, strictly a decoration"
R1B9FKEQ9UZHDF,It works.
R2HWO0E3HHIB2Z,"Exactly what it says it does.. Didn't have it 30 days and the fan started making a rattle noise. Hubby checked it out and the fan blade had come lose and was making the noise. He fixed it, and it works just fine now."
RRRDVQ736I1Q1,Fits my Wonderluxe dual fuel stove. Used it for 2 months now and so far so good.
R1SN2HK9U2XDAZ,"Works as described, but I gave it 3 stars because it started rusting after the first use. We've been trying to keep it oiled to help this, but the rust is a big problem. I would not buy again."
R20XPSZZ7W5TP,"This reclaimer is the best!Easy installation, works great.Heats up the room in no time."
RJAC3GI232Q6Q,"If you have an older stove, like the 25 year old 1300 I have, be aware that the shaft for the shaker handle is not included on this replacement part. I had to take a grinder and cut the shaft out of the old grate. One other note, the original grate would not rotate more than maybe 15 degrees in each direction while this one will go the full 90. Believe me, if this happens, you have a mess because you now have coals dropping instead of just ashes."
R12UONC7TCJ46S,Box badly damaged and one broke. Leg
R1LGT72X1UBE3T,"I just got this in the mail. It came in a huge box with no padding so it was free to flop around. I previously posted the question asking if it has a latch. 2 people said it has a latch. It doesn't have a latch. It has a bar that goes across to prevent the door from going inwards, but not to stop it from opening. Since it doesn't secure shut it doesn't meet the fire code where I live. Apparently people are answering questions that have no clue what a latch is."
RU12N6EU441O6,Misleading title and description.I foolishly didn't read the reviews.Buyer beware.
R3TQYKEAT98JFW,"Barrel flanges fit great. The two mounting legs however, don't fit worth a damn.they are angled too much (for/aft) where they bolt to the barrels.I got them working good enough. It just seems for the money they could be much better thought out.By the way, don't go thinking the name actually means they are made in the US.If I had to do over, I'd buy a different set."
RNBCTZELU54B3,OK
R3SR201UAN6UJB,Arrived quickly. Solid construction.
R2B9KZ3YI50RZ7,"For the 2nd year in a row we ordered the G42 grate, 10x20x2.5, and we received a grate that was about 5 inches wide, same as last year. So we will use them both in our Vogelzang logwood stove, sitting side by side. The stove number is Vogelzang D329.030/D327.540. Since the grates only last about a year I suppose we will have to find a grate that fits locally... Sad that you order something twice over a period of time and it's messed up each time!!"
R1MT8XG3R7SE9Q,Bought this for my French County kitchen. Love it
R1ZMJCKHV9MZG4,Bought this for a family member as hers broke. She said it works great and was easy to change.
R1EI480VRHMSD4,My husband installed this in 30 min.we love that it is made in U.S.A Works great.
R18HH4G3P4J5HM,Arrived all in good shape. Pretty happy with everything so far.
R2Q7VER9G998GI,Exact replacement. Worked perfecrly
R1X30HAHEXU17M,Thanks for letting me know That the Barrel was not included... Now I'm stuck with it
RDPGKGDTGO01,The product was much smaller than anticipated.Held very little water due to its size.Only had for a couple weeks and the edges began to look like they were coming unraveled as if we had it for years.Too small for a wood stove.Refilling it with water all night.To top it off it began to rust on both the bottom and the sides.Very disappointed with this product!
R3V9EYZZ8JDCZD,Broke within a month
R1V2YK56N0OYG8,Same as original. Packaging wasn’t the greatest.
R21PAZ0DKE78MY,Showed up broken and now I’m getting the run around
R1V9STGAL5ZYPU,This item work just fine in my pellet stove. Thank you very much. Have a great day !
R1D7XV48J97N8,Used these to replace my old ones. So far they've handled having bigger logs banging against them. Good for the price.
R1XWMOW30EMKPD,THE FIRST TIME I USED IT THE MOTOR WAS DEFECTIVE. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT BUT MY RETURN TIME RAN OUT. I NEED A PHONE CALL 509 832 27401
RPZBISMVDV3BS,Was exactly as described.
R2PU330P80V86P,I have called and emailed the company three times about this stove with no reply.It is a disaster in every way.Poorly designed and cheaply produced in China.Do not buy this stove.
RLZBI231O84VX,"Everything else seemed to be in great besides one leg that was broken, seems to be a well made product."
RKN7L6Z9N3FGH,These were very high quality and the fit was excellent!
R1SX6MMIYAPCJM,"This is a great product. Installation was pretty seamless. I used a 30gal drum and there were some minor gaps on the stove pipe connector because it's obviously smallerthan a 50gal drum. Buy some high temp caulk and lay a nice thick bead before you attach the door and stove pipe connection and you won't have any issues.And definitely use a jigsaw, idk why all these howto videos on YouTube tell you to use an angle grinder..."
R301L4S618SFTI,This pos is beyond terrible.
RD8T73BCRVPJZ,"This stove was a major disappointment. After installation, I experience MAJOR issues with smoke back-drafting out of the stove into the house. We checked everything......tried every fix....finally, a wood stove expert came out to look at it. The fiberglass wool sheet in the top of the stove, which the smoke is supposed to pass through, was blocking the flue. We finally pulled the fiberglass wool out and it now functions semi-properly. However, we still struggle with smoke pouring out of the stove each time we open the door. Definitely would not purchase this again."
R1MGFJ6PYS6XLZ,"Rust Rust Rust, You people do realize this is cast iron? Some of you may have skipped science class all together. I put a nice coat of bar+chain oil on the chicken and tossed it up on the stove to season in. Repeated again and it will probably outlast us on earth."
R31DWI49X7RW2A,Worked great and came on time
R1K8SNVCV6MXIQ,Well worth what I paid. Most kits have barrel stove wrote on door. This one had the flames. Being different than most made it even cooler.
R1YS5A6KUDRK9N,"The most interesting and useful things are:We self install and the ease of Installation is challenging. We've, over the years, installed several. Its easier to install each time. We use large screwdrivers and a rubber mallet to install. If you aren't handy have someone who is install it. Because we remove the firebricks when installing we replace those that are cracked or broken.Life Expectancy:We use this stove to heat our entire small house of approximately 1100 square feet. We've used the stove for approximately 10 years. Thus from October to late March we run the stove every day and night.The life expectancy for the Baffle is approximately one season. We recommend everyone purchase several baffles along with spare firebrick to insure availability when needed.We cut wood often to be used to warm our house.Before this stove we heated our house with Propane.The cost per month was $400.00 and the house never had a warm satisfying cozy warmth.We switched to the wood stove, spent approximately $1000.00 to purchase the stove and have it professionally installed.Our propane bill is less than $10.00 / month (we use propane for cooking.). The stove paid for itself in approximately one season.We do spend probably 14 days at 8 hours / days / season to get and split wood. (We have several chain saws and keep fresh chains on them...buy a quality professional grade chain saw to cut plenty of wood.) We have approximately 12 or more chords on hand to make it through a season. We burn mostly Ash, Oak, Walnut sometimes, Maple and sometimes we throw in a few small pieces of hedge.We live in Nebraska. This morning was under 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and I put large logs in late last night at approximately 11:30 P. M. and put on more logs at 4:30 A. M. this morning and again around 8:00 A. M. By 9:00 A. M. the house was comfortable.I wish the life expectancy of the baffle was longer than one season. I'm sure a baffle with the steel necessary for a longer life would cost much more. If I knew its life expectancy were longer I would be glad to pay more."
R2DAOYWR6427IE,"We bought the Double Barrel kit in conjunction and it does a great job of heating our out building.The instructions are written well and we found a few suggestions handy once it was assembled.Overall, we are very happy with both of the kits.If it does well enough to completely warm up a building in northeast Ohio in February, I will certainly post another review."
R26PD3MRQK3D2G,It works well.
R55Y9VR3C3RJ,Smaller than I thought and have had it about a month and it’s rusted.
R28CIFPGNA65VF,gift
R1I7ZYFRX539Z2,Well made. As advertised.
R3AOYD3AF7VL8L,great quality - solid build. My chimney sweep wondered where I got it (it was better than the one he usually installs).
R38YWQT2D4J51T,Great product and very easy to install
R184MYNQLX9CJB,We used this to turn a barrel into a sap evaporator. Worked great!
R3E5UDQX7I3U3Y,"Not sure why everyone was complaining about bad parts, the kit I received was in great condition and all of the parts received were high quality, heavy duty cast iron. I used a 55 gallon galvanized steel barrel that I cut 1/3 of the barrel off and spot welded the lid back on. I then used some black furnace cement caulk and sealed the weld, let it dry then painted the entire barrel with 2000 degree red furnace paint. After that I used the kit and attached all the pieces which fit beautifully. Overall I am very happy with my purchase!!!"
R1H0VV0KB5IZOB,Stove came missing parts. I contacted US Stove who never responded.
R1CUOCSIHSQRPA,"All bricks arrived padded carefully so no cracks. Easy to cut with a diamond blade on a circular saw, Quick job refitting an old stove."
R682N9Z4GD5CX,"Received product today...speedy shipping. BUT...opened the box and whole box is trashed,smashed and hardware falling all over the place. One leg is broken in half. Now project comes to stand still. Unacceptable!!"
RIF57YB9YT2LM,"great item for a diy project! the door seals very nicely, solidly built for sure. i just finished constructing my wood stove from 3/16"" mild steel and lined the bottom, sides and rear with firebrick. note to others: make sure your distance from the exhaust(flue) to the front of the stove is shorter than the distance from the top of the stove to the top of the door entrance, or smoke will come out the door when opened. remember smoke follows the path of least resistance"
RZ0B9HQ7W2EVU,"Fit like a glove, thanks."
R1N0GJ3MS7TF84,once I get to install it all....it's going to be wonderful.
R1ABBWV60PR38R,Exactly what we wanted. Works great and shipped fairly quickly. would recommend.
R3E1WIWSIYCY5Z,Misleading you get a partial kit.
R1L9PH4DAFU1LY,GOOD ITEM GOOD PRICE GOOSD DERVICE
R1FHZ8K0LNPTCH,Stopped working the third day.Fan broke.
R3H9JI6GNEPHWN,"I like the stove its economical affordable heat I picked mine up at rural king in store cheaper than anywhere else 199I was looking was installing it with my dad in my tiny home.When we started fire to see if it was getting enough draft to see if everything was right it was drafting back into house awful then when we thought we had it agian smoke agian got smoke all in my house.Come to find out that blanket, fiberglass whatever it is that was in top part of the inside of the stove caused it we pulled it all out through the flue and it works fine now im using it now.So I did remember reading someone else had same problem on some reviews I read so to save you the trouble I had TAKE THAT STUFF OUT OF YOUR STOVE.I would have give better rating if not for trouble so hope this is helpful THANKS!"
R1NU771118P71B,Spent hours on the install. First fire it worked for an hour then quit. Piece of junk.
R3PIU61LCNGSC6,fit and runs quiet
R1ZG9RB48SYMLG,best price fit like a glove
R3BXIILXBOCV41,best price on line fits and works well
R1HVSV32X403G4,Not accurate on size! Right part but 1/8 inch off on depth
R3SAIF8CL932X,Extremely fast shipping. Part very well made. Works perfectly
RMZLAL3Q5WUQP,Got them to line my firebox on my smoker. They were a little large so I had to cut a few shorter to fit. Works great and saves my firebox bottom from burning out when Iuse wood chunks in it!
R2Z5T11CPQSC0T,Exactley what i needed.
R2SV7F64SY1Y3W,"I ordered this product and then placed on shelf until I such time that I could assemble. My mistake. Pieces missing and a configuration of brackets that are very difficult to assemble. The brackets and pre-drilled holes do not even allow for a tool to get to them to tighten. Additionally, the brackets/legs do not fit to the barrel. I made it work, but I wished I had shopped around. I do not recommend this kit, or their double barrel kit."
R220VT37XNHAF2,"Decided to send this one back - it's not very thick compared to the original (7 lbs), so it doesn't surprise me that folks are finding that they don't last very long.It's probably fine for light use applications."
R35WJ036VD5XBO,great
RWLPBSX46Z1IH,Perfect as described!
R3TAMGRYVY4FOV,"This stove company is very poor quality, my board went just after the year warranty and the replacement parts are very expensive. Not a happy customer. I bought ,from tractor supply. They were not able to do anything to help me."
RS4KDMQFIDE3Y,"The liner matched in size, but it appears to be made a little thinner than the original. Since this is the first one I bought since purchasing the stove in 1994. We'll see if this one makes it 23 years."
R1A4A8CL45S7JG,Worked well
R9HPLIYCFDLG6,Great product-easy to install. I used it to replace an outside clean out door on my mother's chimney.
R2USPMY4FN4IYB,We have had this stove almost 3 years.I can't remember how many primary burn baskets we have had to replace.I know for the last year they have burned through in around 3 months.Burned through to where they were unuseable.The company's response is that burn baskets need to be replaced.The stove itself has now started to crack at the weld between the burn basket and the damper.I don't recommend this stove and deeply regret buying it.
R1O1O52R7H6UXS,This top barrel kit made big difference in heat into my shop. I put rocks and concrete pieces in top barrel. Holds heat much longer now too.
R17K7L3NZXW2CE,Great product
R2F7N548JI1HBM,"I bought this. Castings are quite thin, not very heavy, and not gasketed either. Made in China in spite of its name - I am disappointed."
R30HN0ZH5INPM8,Great product
R3Q5HSZ6VZ1KL4,Works great for box stove
R3VE8RU41EGY2Z,Does the job.
R3TJTULDBVSP5J,worked great came with all the bolts needed
R2QJKYWX8HPSJT,It was a direct replacement fit like a glove perfect
R1ZMF6BGTGRKLX,Awesome thanks to Vogelzang for a great birthday gift for my wife. She has a collection of rosters and hens and this one actually gives something back! She love the fact it will bring her favorite scents and potpourri into the house but it also adds to our decor.
R2KTSS1C834VFP,"Looks good, not assembled it yet but have others in use by Vogelsang."
R2D66ME0T37BGT,Fit like a glove!Great deal!
RAUXPKQIS3OIE,Fit and finish are top quality.Highly recommend for a replacement of crappy builder grade doors.
R3HYXZRDX3UN1N,"Works as it is supposed to, one was cracked on arrival."
R2L5SLI2O0OCET,worked as needed
RN60ZB4BPUNGH,fit great
R33NHELFQ149U3,"Makes a nice patio heater. Not a nice looking as other brands, but the price is good.Easy to install / build. Will heat a shed or outbuilding well. Get a grate for the bottom, the barrell will last longer."
R3SBERTQWFD4DT,Yea this was worth it
R96PHTES5NVZO,I ordered 4 boxes of these totaling 24 bricks 4 out of my 24 were broken upon arrival.
R31HSY2R3LJ9YI,excellent quality.the item was delivered ina few days.thank you.
R2OHM6137G0LYB,"They are what they are... firebricks. I received all 6 in one piece, which was a plus. I was able to cut them down to size very easily using a Dewalt mutli saw with an all purpose reciprocating saw blade. My wood burning insert was actually purchased through US Stove, and these firebricks are 3 times the price buying them through the US Stove website. Great deal overall."
R3KQVXZES13T4W,Met my needs... JustwantI wasafter
R2HEZCEL5L7HDO,legs arrive broke
R28GD2JZR940QP,"Ordered an 8 inch in error. Needed a 6 inch, but by the time we where ready to install the 30 day return window had closed. Now im stuck with an 8 inch i cant use. I had to reorder the 6 inch one to complete the job. Is there any way to return the 8 inch for refund?"
R12N4PDY11X0BY,Great bricks for inside my Oklahoma Joe Highland Smoker. Have not noticed any diff in heat dispurse. Keeping anyway.
R36YJLVVC0NWZS,Two of the six bricks were broken into several pieces when the package arrived. They were loosely wrapped so they could move around during shipment - which they obviously did. The bricks themselves are lighter and more porous than older bricks I have - don't seem very well made.
ROISJ8I288CTX,3 of the 4 bricks I used broke the first time I used them! Might as well call them fire eggshells.
R2WR39FTDKU07H,"I've not had a chance to use it yet, but it is the perfect size for my stove that is installed in my living room fireplace. Packing could have been better though, as the top was inverted into the bottom and rubbed some of the finish off. I'm sure a quick spray of high heat paint will fix it. Can't wait for a cold snap to try it out with some oils orother scent sachets!!"
R19OA5HHJ1LDAE,worked well to line our fire pit outside so we can protect the stone.All bricks arrived in good condition.
R3KZ2S9HMLSU94,"We have to buy it. It seems to warp about every 3 years, sowe replace. Have to replace this more than I care to too, but we have no choice. So I will keep buying!!"
R2PZEZ4S3ZUXGQ,The grates don't seem to hold up as long as I would like. But we like our wood heat so we keep replacing them.
R1NRMEQU1FNMOH,Good set of fire bricks for home use in stoves and fireplaces. There was no temp rating on the listing for this product so I ordered it for use in a forge. I put one in a gas forge to see how it would react to 2600 degree temps. In short it turned to glass. (See Pic) I would recommend for home use but no industrial or maker applications requiring higher heats. Not suitable for Forges or kilns above 2k degrees. The brick composition seemed good and as with all firebricks they are somewhat fragile but porous enough to work well with refractory cements.
R30W5YI27PRLDN,"Solid product, easy installation."
R284MUM6ZHHCJ5,"Received 12 bricks last Friday, unboxed it and all the bricks were fine. Put them to aside till I was ready to assemble it a few days later & noticed a hole in 2 out of the 12 bricks. Looks like it wasn't compressed well & doubt they'll last figuring it happened with out even being used yet."
RU41EVTH3MSWX,"A US Stove 80230 Blower Motor was ordered, a US Stove 80594 was received.The difference between the two is the 80230 has open bearings with oil tubes (which last much longer) the 80594 does not.The 80594 has sealed bearings.When the lubrication is used up in the 80594, so are the bearings and you have to purchase a new unit.The 80594 is the current replacement for the 80230.Don't bait the consumer with a superior product (The 80230) and switch to send them a product that is not as well made (The 80594)."
R342KVQ1ZAAO5,Excellent.Bought 12 pcs and none came broken. Definitely would use them again. Product very well packaged.
RUBGFIHSFHHO9,"Decent product but I suspect they won't last near as long as the originals.They are very porous.Though packed as well as humanly possible the corner of one was broken.I found a spot where it will work though so no big deal.My woodstove is in a second home I use mostly in the summer so these will probably do OK.They were sized as advertised but I still had to trim a couple before installation.Had they been denser I could have tapped them in but, as porous as these are, tapping wouldn't have been wise.If you use the stove heavily or intend these for heavy duty use look elsewhere.Cheap but you are getting what you pay for with these."
R31OS30FQ3NGL1,Good quality brick
R3JQ6VN01G1P4A,We purchased this wood stove for the winter. We hooked up the stove to existing pipes and every time we tried to use it smoke billowed out from all around it. A local chimney sweep stopped in and pointed out how it was unsealed. We had to rely on electric heaters for the winter. Disappointed we wasted our money on this.
R2GSU6UGRVRX2D,Warnings:California Proposition 65 Warning: WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer andbirth defects or other reproductive harm.
R3H2VG0X0A9ZTM,It's an iron chicken that holds water.
RT9KBQ0DV2SB1,"I put these in my propane forge to use as a sacrificial floor.The first couple of times I fired the forge up I did not run it very hot because I was heating pretty thin stock.These did fine did fine.But when I cranked the gas up to heat thicker stock these bricks melted.This doesn't necessarily make them an inferior product, but the fact that the seller does not list the rating for them is objectionable.Basically these are a waste of money if you are using them in a forge.I don't know the temperature at which they melted because I can't measure the temperature in the forge, but the 3,000°F firebricks I bought on another site did not melt."
RC3J11W49ZDOS,"I bought these to convert my 22"" Weber into a smoker, which works quite well, but the bricks are very light and fragile, one cracked a bit and I never got the grill over 210 degrees. I will be wrapping these in heavy duty foil to help preserve their life."
R1M3SURY5N58BG,"Arrived broken. The top hinge was split apart. There could have been more broken but, I didnt bother going through the pieces further after seeing that, just closed the box and repackaged it for return. Ordering another to see if I can get an intact kit. If it doesn't come intact the second time I dont know what Ill do. Wish I could find another barrel stove kit that wasn't made in China and arrived in such poor condition."
R2VZRNPFEKIF1L,"I ordered 12 bricks, 1 showed up broken.Box was way too large. Air pillow packaging was used on two of the sides but the other two sides were just up against the edge of the box."
R29FPOB21B14G2,are not durable - several are broken before usage or on a positive side they come pre sized in many options that may or may not be the sizes you ordered;but make it work
RYU1YYCYZ7B4O,Terrible.
RCC7LBCGTAPZT,Good product.Easy to install with a grinder.Look on YouTube.
RZ3BCQ4CYTN6C,Nice and solid. Latches. It was exactly what was needed.
RKBITEURQXYTX,The cast iron legs will easily break as you try to fasten them. The air control is poor. Much of the heat goes up the chimney! The only good thing is that you can put in fairly long pieces through the top. So as a scrap wood burner out in a shed it does the job. Would not recommend for a home.
RMROGT8RMWLPA,"Very easy to put together for the handyman, hasall of my expectations, works great, great price, I use this 1 I made to heat my pool."
R2AP1II02FQC0E,works as expected.
R1WF5OMVZ8UG6E,"Out of two orders of twelve bricks, one order of six had five broken and one broken of the 6 bricks in the other order. So a 50% fail rate. As I didn't realize this till months later I ate the cost of an entire order of broken bricks and had to re-order six more (one order) hoping to have three more not broke... the current failure rate I've experienced... fingers crossed but as soon as they arrive we're unpacking and inspecting all of them and will notify them immediately for recompense. What a horrible feeling."
RS4G0WSUVRMCZ,Used it this winter on the stove top to put some moisture back in the air.Added some cinnamon sticks and vanilla...the house smelled great.It's a really cute decorative piece as well.
R3TBQICBVN7P61,"Good quality, shipped nicely packed."
R2ZWTUJMN2F1TS,This is our second grate in less than a year.The company was amazing in sending a replacement one under warranty of a year.Will buy again.Thanks.
RNW1VPGESC09K,I haven't installed it yet but it seems to be a very good quality
R28YKEEINDWFXU,works great
R1X31GOXU12OWB,You only get the assembly not the barrel itself
R1TTXXCX2GDS0N,"I really debated between this product and the Minuteman International Cast Iron Clean-Out Door. The two products are similar. This has a great build quality as I'm sure the other one does too, however this product uses a simple latch design to hold it shut. It works very well. The door seals flush with the rest of the housing and the lip that goes around the door helps keep any debris out. While the door does not seal air tight (it seems that none do) it seals well enough to keep almost everything else out. This replaced a steal sheet metal clean out door and looks and seals MUCH better. The entire job took me less than ten minutes to complete.I know you're probably debating between the Minuteman International Cast Iron Clean-Out Door and this one. Just get this one, you won't be sorry. It's cheaper and it doesn't have a screw that will rust later. Sure, that little fire place design is cute, but that screw is just going to give you trouble later.I paired this with Rutland 500-Degree RTV High Heat Silicone and it created a great seal.Since this product doesn't have many reviews, I'll update my review if the product status changes."
R3NT8FBBND9L2P,fits as it should
RJ2G9Y1CB11GP,"Noisier than I expected, and didn't move a large volume of air."
RFAKCCMMGUZNX,Worked great. Easy to install. I used it on a 15 gallon barrel.
R2V0GENT0Z23X,As described good value
R1G1XW3Q5KVF2Y,first one came broke 2nd one okreplacementshipped quick price was good
R2L02F2V2XGGYG,"Works ok, but it clogs up too quick."
R27PAMUSAE3609,"I've had this stove for one complete winter now and I live in Northern New Mexico, in the Rocky Mountains, in a 1300sq ft home and use this as a my primary source of heat with my furnace as my backup source. This was one of the worst winters that we've had in several years here so this little stove really got a work out. In January we had 8 feet of snow & it started snowing on Thanksgiving day and we still have snow on the ground. We had nights as cold as negative 30 but this little stove could keep the house at 90 degrees if I stoked it up. The only problem with it is that it doesn't damper down enough. The way that the door is made, there is no way to damper completely down, so it goes through a little more wood then I would like but I have found that once I have a hot fire in it to switch my wood over to hard woods then close the damper down. That seems to help a lot. I've considered putting a second damper in the pipe, maybe that would help the problem. But other then that it has been a great stove!!"
R10LLRNO32OZYX,Only thing I can say it is as describedand works wellthank you
R38O8FQFLTBZ7F,"I didn't care for this rusted al,its right way"
RJ77RME82WMYB,Basically works. Not easy to install. Curve of legs doesn't exactly mate up with a typical 55 gal drum. Parts started to rust after 2 months of use outside. But it works.
R2C79TN03AM8OD,Handle setup is junk. Thinner than they used to be made. Not worth it.
R3CBXS1YCJOHOK,"I needed to be able to get better air flow within my Hearthstone woodstove and this is how I accomplished that. The legs were too tall so just used the bolts as ""legs"" and it was just the right height. It is a good ol' American product and am thankful for its good quality."
R3PY7G6SYDD77A,Perfect fit.
RJK438X8ZNCUA,Perfect fit.
R1L16BSH01OE8Z,Broke after second fire
R1A466LCMOKKSR,Arrived with one of the legs broken in half.
R33DYBITBUE6RS,Product was well put together. The price point is great for the product. Had no issues with fitting. Well had to grind some bricks a bit. The door I replaced had a shoulder that was only on the corners. This shoulder was crafted on all four sides of equal height and density. Very pleased with the product.
R2A8LLP0QAAEUS,"Fit pefectly in my new wood stove.Helps keep the wood off the fire bricks, which is allowing for a full burn of the wood we are using."
R3U7FI0V8AS4E6,This was just what we needed at a good price.
R35DNNXGEMQ5U0,"These are lightweight bricks. (I believe the white specks are perlite) They are meant more for insulating from heat. If you are trying to cook on firebricks, use the ones sold by Rutland."
R3RZUYWR4WXOO7,"Recived this today it looks a little bowed in middle, have read other reveiws about it wraping, hope not more later after try it out."
R1HNNX6QO0I1FC,"I thougt the seller is play words, I got two small cast iron legs after Ipay so much"
R3HGM93CJKOLIL,Perfect fit product for OEM replacement.
R22OPN78BIE441,"Exactly as described. Good product, shipped promptly."
RN2SU0VE6F6PO,Thank you!
R2GMOBKFS7JB32,Does exactly what I wanted.
R1E2VW6BSHMC85,"Unlike what it says. I bought both the barrel stove kit and the double barrel kit that is sapos to bolt right up... But they didnt come with a handle to open the hot door to add wood, contacted the company and they just told me it should have come with a spring and stopped comunicating... No replacement part shipped to me. Also the adaper kit came with the collars to connect the 2 barrels but they are abiut 3 inches to short... More parts had to be purchased.... Verry unhappy with the quality and customer service..."
R1VHH9HSSUO775,Bends under heat!
R1RG9XI0CSFLLQ,used it effectively from Oct 2016 to about Jan when it bowed in the middle with a big dip.I think it melted in our wood burning stove. Oops!!It is still in one piece but now the middle is dragging.It looks like a good idea but probably needs to be made of steel instead of scrap metal or whatever its made of.
R3PDM2DJXGKCM8,Came in good packaging. Seems to be alot tougher than the old one. Only used it for about a month. We will see how long it last come next winter.
R2MLKI1KFDXW4B,works great
R3D51ZG9B6ADMV,I couldn't be more pleased with this stove kit. Really nice cast iron components. The front door has a very nice relief cast into it. I used the kit to make the barrel into an evaporator for mapling. It worked beatifully.
R3BJTVDJVQJAT4,"Door fit Sloppy on hing ,to much play up and down."
R3HOFIW2KX0RZC,received on time and was as described
R16QF00808UJP,"Fast delivery, product cost was cheaper than I expected. Great job."
R142UWEC97C2AS,"had to cut width to make it fit, but it work out fine"
R1FOMYQ4EKI835,"Excellent product.Easy to install.Some tips:measure the channel to ensure you purchase the correct diameter gasket.Do not stretch the gasket as you press it into the glued channel on the inside of the wood stove door.The gasket is long enough for a standard door.Also, make sure the glue is applied in the center of channel.You Tube has some good, simple videos on how to do this properly."
R1AMTK67JAQZRB,4 of the 6 brick were broken when the package arrived today.
RW3YLCOGHXHXA,as expected
R1CZDB0ZFGM8AZ,Works perfectly.
R1A5X3YIOMRO8X,Cheep handle and legs are week.
R3N7C5DBGX5W3U,We needed a damper to help regulate our wood stove and this does the trick. It's working wonderfully and we have no complaints so far! Now if we can only find someone who wants to chop and stack our wood...
RWHFH6UXNXPEM,"Ordered ""DGK2 3/8 inch Door Gasket""Photo shows a WHITE, tight woven gasket rope. Description does NOT say its graphite infused.The item I received was labeled ""DGK2"", and it was 3/8"", but it was a BLACK, graphite infused, LOOSE woven rope.From experience, I know the loose woven rope shreds way to easily if wood gets bumped or rubbed against it while loading the stove."
R2P5Q3CG7P6R4M,"when this piece in our wood burner broke, thought we were in trouble. Glad we found this. fits just like the original. have been using it every day and night for 4 months. no problems"
R2XNCAD33L25MI,Great
R3GGDSLLNSBQU7,Worked ok...but burnt up in just a few months. I would not buy again
RVVCGE0D2GF8L,"I bought the assembly to add an upper barrel.Pipe thimbles were good quality and finish. Straight forward to install.Legs again good quality and finish. The install was not so straight forward.There is the expected angle on the feet to match a barrel radius.However there is an additional angle added to the feet. This additional angleis curious; I'm not sure why it's there. It added extrainstallation figuring.Overall the parts were of good design, finish and all installation instructions andfasteners were excellent.It's the extra angle that dropped the rating to a 4 star."
R18I307QPYLHNY,"I have a Hearthstone Bennington stove.Grating broke in many places being poorly designed for the heat.Replacement was $250.This $50 grate was much larger but fit perfectly in the stove with the feet removed.It is performing well and if it breaks, I can buy four more for the price of the original grate."
R3KS8FIRMGVSE9,The kit was easy to assemble and the completed barrel stove works great. I was pleased with the quality of the components of the kit. Seemed like a good product for the cost.
R2Q8PHM3B9GUO9,The kit was easy to assemble and the completed barrel stove works great. I was pleased with the quality of the components of the kit.
R37UTTBG9O5HDR,The wires Caught on fire after about 2 months and almost caused a house fire do not buy
R1ERYLHOK8N4ER,A bit confused at first as bricks didn't fit. tried different arrangement and now fit like a glove!
R7XU9JU21AFG2,Broke after six months intermittent use age.Literally crumbled in every area but first bowed and then disintegrated. Poorly made product. Glad I bought a warranty
R6AOKATMQRSWZ,"Sensor initially didn't work, fan kept running. I had to mess with set screw then it has worked fine since"
R26N46HURQTUD7,It's OK quality fan fell off the first day had to locktit the set screw . It makes a lot of noise . Spend the money and by a majic heat . Very cheaply made !
R1M46K9CRMHO0Z,Fast shipping exactly as described
R2I3JZKWLEMWER,Have been using it since the day it arrived!Great!
R39O9WQLJ24C6K,Worked great quality product
R38HT2YY1DFD2H,"Left this item sitting on the top of my toolbox on the back of a utility truck. It flew off going 40 mph and bounced across the black top. Not even a scratch!Very durable, lmao."
R1NY3M9DYQK4BK,Just as desribed
R1OUQ1H803766K,I used it one season and it broke in the middle. Cast iron can't handle the heat. Looking for something else. Open for reccomendations
R2SQQE5YJHYL6,Just needed the parts to build a arch
R3GNEU81TJ6S01,Gets the job done but has it's flaws. The flue is difficult as 1) the damper sits up too high to allow the flue pipe to seat properly and 2) the stove pipe doesn't fit inside the damper so I had to buy an additional adapter. I'm using it to boil down sap and I'm constantly having trouble keep the stove pipe from falling over. I have not had any issues with the the door as some other people have described.
R1T3H5RO4BJZGY,Good product but you need to know what you are doing. If you are handy with tools then you will be fine but if you are just looking for something to do then expect to have some problems with assembly.
R10YGO8EIR9A84,First time I've installed a damper. Watched a video and had it done in 5 minutes. Easy to do and it works great!
R2M69ZL1QSWJKW,worked great just thought it was quite expensive
R22FMVXPTE8LLU,Wrong rotation for my stove. Did not see indication of rotation in product description.
RVP24MKBF6AA5,This fit perfectly and less expensive then ordering from the US Stove CO>
RBAU1EVOOPWRU,"Barely feel the fan blowing at all,pretty disappointed"
R3A3WALT0PW68Y,A
R388TC0XTELP96,"I have not had it long, but it does exactly what I want it to. Having a good draft is king. I live in the pacific northwest so I usually don't experience extreme temperatures. It is the best option for a power outage and I don't intend on running it full time. I couldn't be happier."
RZ1TYG118T3UY,only needed the collar.would be great if I could have bought individual pieces instead of the whole kit.
R1U9P6IOFESUQJ,Works well. Was pleasantly surprised by the thermostat. Is getting a little noisy. Didn't work immediately due to not being plugged in well enough. Oops. Showed up on time and you couldn't beat the price.
R3TSRDFH3QLJCU,"just what i needed, thanks."
RGD4S11P18DXI,Cute but smaller than I expected.
R343RVPT46HGQE,"Not as pictured, very low quality set. Found it cheaper and better constructed at local hardware store. They must have changed design or supplier.... Terrible really"
RWQYEO0W41SA6,Great starter kit.
R21C8B3QS8VPDL,As described.
R3NN2EIXRF5DC6,"I purchased this to make a stove from a barrels, the barrels are so thin I was afraid to use this kit to make a safe stove. I understand the older barrels are made of thicker metal but very hard to find."
R39RKN4S90PWWA,Exactly as advertised and expected.
R1YVBCISA5C7EK,"Should be for decoration only, when water used it crates a thick rust sludge inside"
RNX92HYI9I4OP,We love it. Want to buy 2 more next year!
RHAVEI594T577,Bought this late November already warped.Less than one season.
R9ZAG7MD1E1MU,Works as described.
R1A5XVY5E5JVWE,Buy the cast iron agitator # 40500
R1622TTVEZY4T3,Great product
ROTXP00CPF29B,Fan doesn't blow very well had to buy a fan to put behind it. Not very happy that I had to spend more money on this item.
R3BLXZBESOFNRD,Maybe holds a quart of water.I would have to refill more times than I would have to add wood to the stove.Useless!!!!!
RDETFZIT0M8,"This item is really cheap.It doesn't appear to bereal cast ironand rusted the first time I used it.I read on other comments that it needed to be seasoned which I did, and it still rusted. I would not recommend it to anyone!"
RK3WO6NVW8TQF,Money saving!
R2GRMO1UYMPVM6,just what I needed to fix the stove
RKICTVTPHX46X,"fit perfect, saved the stove for lots of years of use"
RDAOYUWKQONQ6,Easy to cut - nice quality
R2TLABCOQEBWQ7,"I am well satisfied with the heater kit. My intentions were to order the single barrel kit, but I ordered the kit for the top or second barrel by mistakeso I reordered the bottom part and used both and I'm proud I did. It surprised me how much heat the top one is producing. I'm also surprised that it doesn't use much wood. Made a great heater for s 70 foot shop!!"
R2KWGQCT2RN2DO,great
RDNP8PR9UM5E6,Exactly what I expected
R275CMKM6TKTMG,easy install.slight trimming on one side to fit.
RLG8IMFQ16C70,"Perfect garbage.Radio of adapter legs doesn’t match 55 gallons barrel. Also, adapter legs don’t position at 90 degree with the barrel. The two flue collars don’t have the same bolts pattern; radio of male is smaller then radio of female. Because poor information, now I have to swap then and I will have to drill another set of holes. Even it says US STOVE ADAPTOR, it is one more Chinese Scrap."
R1EGGXHXD5OFVU,The bottom is uneven and wobbles. I didnt realize that until after I seasoned it so I doubt I can return it.
R3MPV6YW4S6503,Not as big as I thought it would be but otherwise works great. Fast shipping.
RS8ZI0EKOWQYB,would like more power
R20A76S0GEUV5N,"The first one we ordered was defective,but I had no problem returning it and the new one worked perfectly."
R3DETCVHSA5G0G,"Fit my stove perfectly, lower priced than purchasing direct from the manufacturer!"
R12I0GQGV4S8RW,"Bought this for my old Craft Stove whose gasket had long seen better days. Installation is simple and I have had it in use for better than a week. air control for my stove is much better now than before. These seem to come in two sizes so try and judge the size you need if you don't have your manual any longer which was my case. I went with the 3/8 instead of the 1/2 inch and with the new gasket, my door requires some effort to push it closed enough to secure the latch. 1/2 would have been too thick for my stove."
R4ETG4VSGQ7S4,Works good! Plan to add additional air holes if you want to use a lot of wood.
RY5YC33ZJLO41,same as old blower and fit right.only lasted 2 month . was very noisy from the start.very expensive for what you get
R22N8VAOXTAF8U,Didn't fit as perfect as I liked but works great again not pretty but for shop works great
RKJ5QCF7SOC15,"It's a nice-looking damper, which works just fine.Instructions would probably be good for someone who is a stranger to stovepipes, but I've seen them before."
R12OPXO8BUKAIH,Wasn't super impressed. A lot of the casting material was left on the surface of the part. Not really as well formed as I though it would be. A skilled fabricator can easily make something that looks just as nice. I merely bought the kit for convenience sake. Upon further inspection I am fairly certain I could have made a much nicer solution in my shop.
R31DQV6NWUZVGH,Fit perfectly and working just fine
RFJFCHCDLPQPR,"Robust, well built assembly. No complaints after several weeks of use. 6"" stove pipe from Tractor Supppy or hardware store fits this assembly very well."
R3IBCM6VDFYD9N,Just what I ordered. No problems
R1OGY6R08ZQRRH,"seems to be heavy built have not installed it yet,cant wait."
R19248R4AITDQD,The circulation fan began making some terrible rattling noises within 2 weeks of using it. It still works but it is excessively loud.
RV4PCR5P21J37,"this installed very easily where my furnace output flue is.Just make sure you have clearance of about a foot high by around 10"" by around 13"" for that box.The fan was not noisey, the thermostat kicks on at the right point - it has the heat output equivalent to about what a heater vent would deliver - but it only gives this otherwise wasted heat while the furnace is running (in my case an oil furnace - but I imagine gas would work) - I think you would probably get the best payback for a wood stove.This recovers heat that would likely just go up the flue.I may improve it's heat transfer efficiency by wrapping copper wire around the vertical pipe and through the holes"
RVYAMBOBEQQP7,Finally got to use it today and it worked great just be sure to line up your legs door and damper vertically. If i did it again i would install the legs first then set it on the ground to line up the door and damper.
R2X7MMCT141EQK,7 years and stove is still going strong
R2YLI3TDWRIMFV,Right kind of bricks for my wood burning stove
R31IF09V01W838,THE KIT WAS INSTALLED ON A 275 GAL TANK.HAVE NOT FIRED IT UP YET....
R1830NX5I5UXJ,It works but it doesn't really make any noticeable impact.Update Dec 10 2018It never really did anything but now this thing rattles so badly its not worth leaving plugged in. Definite waste of money
R1SFRQCMJBMG5O,After one good use the grate warped.
R3PN5YMT38T2WD,I am really pleased with the bricks they were easy to replace in our wood fireplace would highly recommend especially since we could not even find in stores
R2N299E52423VL,Smaller and lighter than I thought it would be.
R99P59LUK3XRO,Unit is smaller then I expected and the fan is very weak. It only blows the warm air a few feet. It is quiet however.
R1BP5U1FI75INQ,"hard to install with normal human sized arms, but what did I expect when I live in the past."
R3GU1XKRPAXIC,"Very cute, but also very small.It works well on our very small wood stove, but if you're looking for a real humidifier for a big room, this isn't it.It does work great for adding ambiance especially when filled with mulling spice or cinnamon sticks.If the stove is really hot, the water in the steamer will actually boil and be completely gone within an hour or so.Fortunately, it doesn't damage cast iron to run the water out of it (but if you have mulling bags or cinnamon sticks in it they might burn on the bottom).It is imperative that the steamer be properly seasoned before using it to prevent rust, though.A quick search on Google will come up with how to season cast iron (essentially you wipe it all down with vegetable oil and then cook it in the stove at 350 for an hour)."
R1HIUO7OJ9828A,"They fit, what more is there to say..."
R2L5S15TAVP1OA,"I am using this kit in my WASTE OIL BURNER unit I built. I get Massive heat output and theres no adding wood constantly or fears of burn through. You can go look for it if you want to see it on youtube. "" Building it, Waste Oil Heater How To Fire it up- Living off the grid ""All the parts I got from AmazonSo far, Cheapest priced I found are on Amazon and the scrap yards."
RBIFTNAJA9AU7,Quick shipping and a quality product.
R3VNCX1UBAEYMH,Excellent
RJP9LHU1YO3PF,"I bought the stove because of its size. I live in a small house and this was the smallest one I could find. However, whoever designed it has no business being around wood burning devices. There is a steel plate covering the entire top of the stove with a filter over the top of it. Im not really sure why you'd filter the smoke but the design doesn't allow the smoke to reach the flue anyway. After the initial burning (thankfully outside) I almost sent the smoke bomb back but I would have had to have one built because of the size I wanted. So, I took the stove apart and removed the plate and filter. This took about 30 min. Now it works great! For the price, I'd recomend it to anyone."
R2FGN019SWXO5,Great investment. Fire burns hotter and longer.
RF5Z4CGC5C09W,fits in my furnace like it was made for it. very happy.
R2SSKCZVVZILGW,"I have a GW1949 version that was made in Medford, OR and am on the 3 winter of use.This stove has a number of inherent problems due to the non electric gravity feedsystem that it has and because of them I will be reinstalling my trusty airless woodstove this summer.IF you must use pellets and are in an area that has power outages then this stove is a good choice BUT I do not feel that it can be trusted to run unattended for any length of time more than 1/2 - 1 hour.I would NEVER let this stove run overnight as they can plug and then backburn up the pellet feed line.What a mess to clean up after it occurs.They do need constant cleanout.I usually pull out the burn chamber and scrape out the encrusted unburned pellets that build up rather quickly (1-2 days at 12 hours/day) up the feed line above the burn basket and then vacuum out the mess and the fly ash up the first length of heat exchange/stovepipe.I then insert an electric leaf blower into the chamber and blow out the ash from the stove pipe ( it blows out onto the roof and soon washes away with the next rain).If I do this it will run good for a few days before needing cleaning again.I never had anywhere near this much daily maintenance with a wood stove and I do not worry about leaving a wood stove burning at a low level overnight so back to the wood stove.Unfortunately, I do not feel that I can resell this stove given what I know about it now so I will just hold on to it and hope that when the inevitable recall comes that I can get in on that recall.I give three stars only if used under the conditions I stated knowing the problems you will have as the trade off for it running during a power outage.Just for information this stove has a straight up 14 foot tall 4 inch diameter pellet stove pipe with the exit four feet above the surrounding house and 20 feet away from the nearest tree.Draw is not a problem."
R1JPKNT6WNGMK3,This was a gift for someone bad she loves it!!
R3BRVR1CU4Z2DQ,Great part snd reasonable!
R13WHNVFOH96WD,Package arrived with a broken brick.That's 16% damage.The box was too big for the amount of inflated pillow wrap used - allowed too much movement within the outer box.
R1AFP3KERPZ1FX,Directions for assembly are very poorly written. Illustrations are so faint as to be unreadable.
R3OQTGTG1FN19D,"Note this is long: I've had the US Stove version of the Wiseway for over 4 years. Located in a bricked interior corner of a room that has a vaulted ceiling with 2 ceiling fans running on low. It does a good job of heating a 1500 sq ft area of our 3200 sq ft home when the outside temp is freezing or above. This house was built with 6"" walls and lots of double pane windows in 2000.Our GW1949 was made in China and freighted to us in a cardboard covered wooden crate. It was mostly assembled...the instructions for assembly and installation were clear. The metal burn pot had the bars closer spaced than recommended in the manual. On my third night of use, I had a backburn (where the pellets in the tube leading up to the hopper were smoldering) which caused me several hours of work to clean up. After adjusting the burn pot bars further apart to just under 5/16"" spacing my temperatures went up considerably and the heater breathes much better. I can now run up to 700 degrees for several hours. I'm sure all these pellet heaters run a little different...mostly because they are quite dependent on a good flue that will draw the hot exhaust out of the heater and there are so many variables in flues. I run 4"" exhaust with two 45 degree ells between the GW1949 and the 14' up pipe.Since my install, I usually run 1 to 1.5 bags of pellets/day in this heater depending on how cold it is. Rarely do I run it overnight. If I do not clean it daily (10 to 15 minutes) then on the second day it won't achieve heat above 600 degrees. The cleaning process is a vacuum to suck the fly ash out of the 2 lowest burn traces and a wire brush or scraper to clean the buildup in the burn basket (chamber) and the primary burn tube (fire box).My best results have been with Olympus douglas fir pellets...I get 100 degrees more heat and only 1/3 the ash with the better pellets. Results with softwood pellets that cost 50 cents a bag less are lots more cleaning, fussing in the burn chamber to keep it running well and considerably less heat too.Conclusion: After running this Wiseway for 4+ years and over 6 tons of pellets in this heater to keep my 93 year old mother-in-law comfortably warm. I'm able to do that with quite a bit less work than a log burning fireplace or wood-burning stove. Pellet cost up to $8/day...and it's a bit more upkeep than an electric pellet stove...yet it runs much quieter and you don't plug it in.Greg"

R1AAJZFVQH6TPP,Great product super fast shipping
RNNUN2PC4MO1,"Even though this clicks on and off, probably temperature related, it works wonderful. I didn't know it had a thermostat, thought it just would run constantly, but really puts out the heat!"
RLD8QN613O2HC,Has been working well since it was installed but was a bit pricey.
RRAH0PC55KEW9,Very pleased.
RJOPY80YPA228,"Like it, but it's already rusting after only a couple weeks."
R1XZJQSID90XR5,"just got my wiseway delivered to me, going to get it installed in my 989 square foot home in portland oregon, will update post when i test it out. I got it in good condition no dents or scratches. looks a little different then the picture, the base of it is a large plate lifted about 2 in off the ground and bent down at two edges on the front, (were you can see fire through glass) and back touching the ground and support struts welded to the bottom of it. this one can not have wheels attached to the bottom of it like the one in the picture; This is one reason why i only gave it 3 stars, they need to update their picture! Not to big of a problem for me, i am not going to move it after installing it.fingers crossed and hope it works good!"
R3JSNHMO7KH132,"We haven't had a chance to install it yet, so I cannot speak to how well it works.However, it arrived in excellent packaging (almost too good — it took a lot of effort to open the crate), and it was not too difficult to assemble (different from ""install"").There is one thing that would make this a better product: make a mirror image version. Having the chimney on the opposite side would make the installation easier."
R18E60TZDFNXBN,All arrived with no breakages.Working well in my Napoleon 1402 insert.
R3QGTS5AS7MEDN,fits great in my stove.

R149V7FYOZRJ0J,"Does not get enough air. Had to leave door open some or it would simmer and extinguish.The one leg was built wrong.4 legs. 3 are same size. One was half inch shorter.Flume is a joke.6"" pipe a hassle to fit in.Had to purchase a 7"" flume to go over and notch out around damper handle. I was impressed through.I gave up on it and let it sit until next day.24 hours plus.I opened the door cause I seen smoke still.It caught fire again.Going to make a port on the front for more air.Worth the money but you must tweak it to work properly"
R28V0URWO27FBB,It works. But thermostat is set to high. You have to have a very hot fire or it doesn't run enough to make difference.

R2836D9KQW8BKV,I don't know if this is really cast iron... it's silver metal of some kind that is coated in some black soot that comes off when you touch it... makes a mess... for the price this should have been a much nicer of a product.

R11QVR1DYEUAHS,"Wrong item , used and the shipping weight was 10 lbs and not the 4.5 (5) that I am being given on the return label.The dimensions of this ashpan should be 27x14.5x6..and 4.5 lbs.I received an open ended ashpan that was used measuring 29x9x3 and weighing when packaged 10 lbs. My return label printed for 5 lbs."
R16QMKWUP7YSTH,"just a quick fyi, ANY of these barrel stove kits that have a vent under the door, DONT WORK! the fire needs WAAAAY more air to burn efficiently and produce good heat! I have 3 of these kits and all 3 ive had too use the big cap/plug for a vent! unless ur using a barrel with a removable lid. I highly recommend u put the bottom of the door about 2 inches above the big plug. then get a 2 inch steel threaded nipple and screw it into the hole where the plug/cap was. then make an adjustable plate so u can regulate the air flow. more air=more heat! all 3 of my kits work great. look on youtube, everybody will tell ya that those little vents in the door dont draw no where near the amount of air needed!"
R14FPMUAUGO96L,Worked awesome. just what was needed
R1E9BMGCY03WVH,"This is a replacement for an older furnace. This one is much thicker, maybe 1/8"" vs almost paper thin. Much heaver and handles heat better. Did not give 5 stars as there was no coating on the bare metal. Kinda expensive but what isn't."
R2QL0CUJNJ89IK,Works great.Thanks for your help. It stays blowing when stove gets hot.
R3IK32PARRG4YJ,"I purchased this stove thinking it should easily heat my 1,200 sq. ft. home, since it is rated to heat a 2,000 sq. ft. home. (I even sold my electric pellet stove.) Hooked it up, and it did fine when the temperatures outside were only getting down in the 30's at night. But I live in Northern Maine where the winter temperatures are well below zero degrees, during the day! Right now, the stove can't get the room it is in above 68 degrees. Last night our bedroom was 48 degrees! And this is after I closed off the hallway, meaning the stove now only has to heat about half of my home. In other words, it can't even heat 600 square feet of living space!We purchased and burn 100% softwood pellets (like the instructions say to do). I keep it clean by vacuuming the entire inside out (which requires that the stove be shut down completely). We have an older home, but it is insulated well. The stove runs between 600-700 degrees, and I even installed a new chimney which runs straight up through the roof. It still won't keep this place warm.As it stands right now, I had to purchase another electric pellet stove. This stove is a nice toy for people in Southern climates, but it is no good if you live in a harsh winter environment. Keep in mind that the original WiseWay stove was designed by a guy in central California!I should also add that the stove is made in Communist CHINA, NOT in Alabama like I was told by Tractor Supply!"
R1IADXM89DRQK4,My husband loves his new shop stove.He says it burns very well with a well designed system.Just perfect for his needs at a great price.
R2ATVO0NNT4D1U,This door far exceeds my expectations. An extremely solid product that should last close to forever.
R1HMZSWOS97M2K,This is entirely too small! It is not a correct measurement

R2QMESB6GMXJ9R,"This has worked beautifully in my 40'x40' shop.If you have never done any metal working, maybe it would be better to enlist the help of someone who has (Pizza and beer will normally do it).Im going into my second winter with this in the workshop and I still love it.If I had it to do over, I would have added bricks/sand/(Mass) to the upper barrel.That way it would hold more heat for longer, but it really isn't an issue.The only bad thing i can say is that no matter how well it is drafting, when you swing the front open, you will probably get some smoke in the shop."
R22EDNR1WUVQ65,Was good for about a month and a half then the one grate broke not to happy about it had to order another
R1CCEUMFLD27HY,Rusts as soon as u add water and put on stove
R22WONZN7I6GSE,Worked great but quit after 1 month
R32S22V6EX69M8,STOVE IS WORTHLESS AND WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I have spent up to $100 EXTRA dollars in different methods in trying to get this to work. I WAS a novice in wood stove-drafting-fire-starting-SMOKE CLEARING of a house till i got this stove. I went so far as to pull the stove off of the pipe 90ing out the house so that there was a single section of 3 ft pipe on the stove. I started a fire and little to no SMOKE CAME out of the top and ALL came back inside my house. I have tapped all the resources and knowledge you can about this. NO THE PIPE IS NOT CLOGGED__DRAFTING? i hooked a fan up to it to create a vacuum to PULL and TO PUSH - shortened the stack ---to lengthen the stack--- nothing is blocking the wind----wind isn't pushing it back in the house--- THE STOVE IS JUST GARBAGE. I have done everything possible.
RY0JJJFKM1VAS,just what I wanted very good kitEasy to install .works great..
RWO9ODTXVLUC,"  This is a poorly designed wood stove in that the top of the door is too close to the top of the fire box.As it is there is no way within normal use to avoid smoke coming out of the top of the door.The United States Stove Company doesn'thelp matters by taking up so much space in their user guide and installation manuals trying to explain away the smoke as anything and everything other than poor design.If you have already purchased this stove as I have, there is hope, however.I modified the door opening with a metal flap that allows me to open the door and leave it open while using the full size of the opening for loading fuel without getting a room full of smoke.Take a look at the video to see what I'm talking about.This simple fix has allowed me to rate this stove at a 2 because I am now quite happy with it in my cabin.Afterthoughts...1) My stove also arrived on a smashed up pallet and box.Fortunately, the stove was not broken.It is way too heavy for the packaging they use.2) I have also removed the ceramic insulative blanket from above the baffle.3) I spent last night at my cabin and it was in the teens outside and well below freezing inside the cabin when I arrived after dark.I find until the stove warms up it still had a tendency to smoke a little at the beginning when the door is opened.Once it warmed up I left the door wide open as the fire roared to let more heat out into the room in a hurry."
R5DT7HND2AIHJ,"You can't get the 6"" stove pipe to go over top of the damper or the inside of the damper need some kind of adaptor. Any suggestions on a fix? It makes it hard to use the stove and be safe! At a stand still!"
R1PHVJBUGAA1OY,Works great!
R2MOYY0S9CLQ5M,they were just what I expected
R8EDD61S3QPGZ,"This thing is great for the price, and I think I'll be the first to say I successfully used it on a 30 gallon barrel. The castings are decent quality and they don't make me nervous running this thing in my shed. The radius of the 30 gallon barrel doesn't let the flue collar lay well for a good seal. So to fix that I used a generous bead of stove pipe sealant between the collar and barrel. I only used the inside bolt hols on the legs and tightened them up good with a impact, they seem to hold the barrel just fine. The door will fit in the face of the barrel with about a half inch on each corner to spare."
R2WYTS1TG919JJ,"Works great, easy setup, good quality"
R24L0FIZ57VWPO,Stove showed up broken and is made in China..
R25DJZ568DUNE5,"Works great in our shed in the back. We work in there during the winter on different projects, but since we built it we have not had a chance to use during the winter since we had no heat. Now we can this winter.. Cannot wait!"
RLF9K0IE9K85I,ok
R2RWA4SM4BLF5,Great product. On time delivery and as described.
R18ZN8ZSGPYK8O,"Works very well. My house is ~1200 Sq. Ft. and it heats very well. No issues with smoke, I have a very good draft. FYI there is no air intake control, which you may find in a more expensive stove. Otherwise, it works very well, and when using it I can turn my primary heat off(I live in Upstate New York) I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good economy stove."
R2M7L5WE942AY7,"Got this stove at ace. Use it to heat around 900 ft. It is a bit much for the space but better more than less. Now I did remove damper an put one in the pipe. Double wall pipe to roof, triple wall thur that. If fully loaded an burning turn it off an it stays hot for about 6 to 7 hours. I burn only oak an cherry wood. I put red caulk (high heat) in every place castiron meets. It could easily heat 1200 to 1500 ft. So if you are willing to do a little work, it is great."
R33UE6QHAPAMB9,Rusted throughout after one use - spend the extra to get a baked enamel one!
R2GLNEHQZVNK8H,"using on outdoor covered patio,this really puts out the heat, very happy with price, delivery and overall.I am sure indoors it would be great"

R228126S9F6HC5,YAY!!!! Bricks!!!!!
R1GRQRMF4XTYB,"The fit and finish on the castings is such that you get your moneys worth, for the most part.I would have given four stars if were not for the fact that the kit was short 11 screws to where three of the legs get only one screw per mounting point and the lucky leg gets three screws.It may not have been such an issue in concern if the assembly took place not at a remote hunting camp, but where extra screws might be available. As it was, moving the assembled stove around had to be very carefull so as to not knock legs off.Overall its a good stout cast iron door and stack spud."
R17CDWJS1UOUBK,Works greT
R3FOVTUWR7IZAW,This was a gift to the Standing Rock Sioux pipeline protesters who state they REALLY like this stove.
RH76SVFT69S7W,"Comes complete will all the parts you need to make a barrel stove kit--- less the barrel.but those are easily obtainable! . . .And you cant really beat the price!Seen same & similar at higher prices--- then add shipping...This item has Amazon Prime, so shipping is free for Prime members!Getting anxious to use this now that we have it built."
R29EHAIG6L4QI0,"I like it, but one of the legs had a crack in it, that we didnt notice until after assembly was complete.Great concept, double barrel wood burning heater!"
R2YT29XR947ASE,meets expectations
R2XYSWW1UYL34A,Meets expectations
R1KVBY0YELC4TR,Awesome im using in a barn had know problems keeping it toasty
R10TT75MD1G4I8,This device fills the room with the warm air that usually escapes up the chimney
R94DEEFBCMATD,"My parents have to pick up a new grate for their wood stove every couple years due to the stove getting really heavy usage. They burn through close to 8 cords of wood in a year as the wood stove is used as their primary heating source. These grates are pricey no matter where you buy them, but you definitely get them cheaper on Amazon then you can at the local hardware stores. My mom had commented that they were going to need a new grate for this season and that my dad was going to look for one at the local store. My parents are old school and don't look for things online. So I looked on my phone real quick and told them what the price would be to get one here on Amazon, my dad went by the local hardware store and returned empty handed. The local store was close to $50 more expensive than what was available here on Amazon. I ordered this up for them and in 2 days they had their grate. They were super happy to get it cheaper and see that it came directly from the stove company made them confident it wasn't a cheaper junk version.Definitely worth grabbing this if you need a new grate!"
RT3W22CV7F3D5,"Did not come with door gasket, or nobs !It did come with a spring? No clue what it's forBut for the price not to bad"
RW35H7CUWU08M,as advertised
RARWZAJAR4NHH,Cheap grates.3 in four years.I recommend another stove. *Update* Another year another grate!4 in 5 years now. Don't buy in to US Stoves customer service answer about seasoning your grating either. It's all BS!It doesn't help much and the customer service rep was not very friendly. As soon as I said I was calling about my grate I could tell she had heard it from many other callers.
R2FT49FPC5EMQN,It's great
R1TUVOENXOW6TZ,Had to modify as standard 6 inch pipe did not fit it
RF51DBA9FMB42,these things are sweet. been using them for ten plus years. just bought my second kit!
R1JT2ZMU503JPB,"We were very worried that this would be a cheaply made product that didn't last long. Especially after reading a review that said it was ""at best cast aluminum"". But this set is definitely fully cast iron and heavy. We will be using some of the parts on our smoke house. We are not using it to make a barrel stove."
R2IAJKYSBHGGQQ,Simply awesome. I am using this to heat my pool with a copper coil. I like the product but be prepared to repaint it with high temp paint because the cheap paint will cook off.
R3PHZHBH16XU67,Works great. Beats my 1200 square ft shop. You may not need the second barrel kit.
R2FZ8BW73IS2T7,Looks good works fine. It's a bear to get to the screws inside through. Should be self taping.
R1ONSPACGKM76F,couldn't use it
R34QQUWHSFEHYE,Worked perfectly in my newBBQ.I've cooked several times and the are as new.
RSYWK2MPLM9A0,Good quality ..... fair price.
R38QQYHJMSTOAT,Built a heating system for my sons green house. 20ft by 75ft. does a nice job
R11I0NH7LAPBFJ,Not as heavy duty as originals but they will work.
R3W1UFLTKG51DP,the legs are to short! but other than that its a great kit.
R3TXGNZI38PKY3,a
R162XYBWEXD882,This dumper in the picture is not the same with one I received and also did not seem to work because the pin does not stay locked when .I send it back for a refund.
R20A0O1D0XSG3Q,It worked perfectly for making an inexpensive stove for my smokehouse.
R1HQVHML6CZV9Y,Made in China. Be ware... The cast legs were broken when I received it. I guess I wrongfuly ASSUMED it was made in the US. It got returned
R1O73CD0MUFU89,"I am a little confused, the photo of the door installed on the 55 gallon drum and the instructions do not coincide. Photo has door centered on drum while instructions say install with vent door over smaller bung.Overall the kit seems to be well made except for the cheap metal catch for the door latch.US Stove BSK1000 Cast Iron Barrel Stove Kit"
R3UZVUPORR98GJ,Is not the same as the orgional us stove model 1300 shaker. Cheaper built. They offered this when I searched for the parts. Thin seems kinda cheap. Don't know where they get the price is worth what you get. aup date.... after buying it and writting this review I was right. it broke after a week of use. So yes its cheap. go to tractor supply.
R2BTA8LDA5Y4WI,Description stated this would fit a 36 gallon drum but it doesn't
R3NOZA31PLVAPA,Dampened my pipes
R359KGZI0BU6AY,Legs broke even before I used it
RWJKC3GCTRNZV,"Still putting this stove together... somewhat difficult without templates for the legs and stove pipe, but for the price, a solid purchase"
R376UW1WFCR16Q,Great product. Northline Express is an excellent vendor! Love that I get so much more recovered heat from the wood that I burn!
R2DPK1F3TWQ7T8,It showed up broken! Third one in a row!!!!
RACRIA9WDAM2H,installed at camp and the boys like it. Just what we needed
R4CD4G2RO81U4,Items was a Christmas gift was well appreciated....
R2SKM54AV6BRBV,bought this on prime day best deal around
R1DIRD7LT1MTHO,"Another Update, we have found you can only use dug fir pellets, ther pellets don't get to 600f and above, and out house needs that.We also use a c clamp on the window, keeps smoke out of room.Update, after using this thing 5 times there have been issues.Takes an hour to get to temp where it starts toi be effective.I have to constantly put air into intake to get temp up.I would not get 1949 model but the 2014 if you want this.We wish we would have bought a regular otc stove at this point.But, this will give you heat for a day once you get it started.Wowzers, this is a great pellet stove. So if there is a con let's get those out of the way.Number one, it is 40,000 BTU, now that isn't terribly powerful but it is perfect for the cathedral ceilings in our 2200 sq ft house.Also, you have to use a propane torch to light this, no real way around that.You also need to clean the unit a little after each bag of pellets to maintain efficiency.You will have to buy burner baskets every couple seasons as well, places sell them for 45 dollars.That is where the cons end.One statement is make sure you can vent it through the roof and not the side, this will allow it to maintain efficiency.You should find a way to protect your kids from contacting this unit if you have kids.This stove must have created by a super genius.It is completely silent and uses NO electricity.You can also buy a fan you tap in and the heat runs the fan, again no electricity..Perfect for country houses or any off grid stuff.The unit is pretty small, looks much smaller in person then on videos.I received a unit with a different bottom, I like it better then the unit shown.It is flat and solid.One bag of Pellets lasts 36 hours and the room is heated slowly and solidly.There is a temp gauge that shows the temp, usually between 500 and 700 degrees.The only thing you need to do is empty the burn chambers, very little work per bag of pellets, and once this thing is lit there is nothing to do except enjoy the heat.We priced new central heating because we have no gas here, and everything was 20k or more.We bought this unit and it will be our heat source for life.Our neighbors will be cold when the electricity goes out, but we will be toasty.This Product is one of the neatest coolest things I ever bought.Check out the youtubes, that is what we used to decide to buy this.Anything under 3 grand is a fair price in my opinion.It isn't too heavy either, and one side is completely cool so you can point that to the wall.All of the heat comes from the window side.It is amazing!!!Update, I AM CONSIDERING TAKING OFF ONE STAR BECAUSE OF FIT AND FINISH ISSUES SHOWING UP AS I USE THE STOVE.ALSO, I HAVE BEEN GETTING TOO MUCH SMOKE IN THE ROOM, BUT THIS ISSUE CAN BE FIXED.For now I will leave it the same, will update again after a full winter 2016 of using it.Will update jan or feb 2017."
RNB5B5LH6OQVQ,very good
RWT4G47RP8G8P,good
RO7WU2GHACTX1,great firebricks I use in my smoker to keep my grill warm and keep temp up over all great bricks for good price
R12DUHIGEN7BL,Came intact and work as advertised.
R1057ZGZ7W44AF,alot to mess with..
R2PS8O628VF1UX,Great door
ROVIRXDUICBZ0,Low quality firebricks at a high price... I figured it was stupid to buy masonry supplies online out of convenience... Proven.
RUWURC7HF8NZJ,"The ceramic blanket stuffed in the top was bunched up so the stove couldn't breath. Took the stove apart to lay the blanket flat. Took the stove apart a second time to take it out and now it barely breaths. With the blanket in, the fire just smoldered; no actual flame until after the door stayed open for minutes.The air supply is very inadequate and not adjustable. Smoke billows from the box when the door opens. Unsuitable for any ""living space"" use. May be OK for a tent, detached garage or detached shop.The stove breathes so poorly the top does not get hot enough to heat a fry pan. It will heat water for coffee.As an experiment I set the stove outside with only two lengths of flu just to verify it wasn't an installation problem. Nope... still doesn't breath even with ""straight pipe"" for a chimney. Wood was dry cedar split to ~2"" thick wedges. I've left the stove outside. I'll make a smoker out of it."
R28HH0CCLVN2E1,"High Quality, Best Price"
R2IYRJOXA3VZRI,I always buy this from here whenever I need to replace ours. Good quality and price. No hassel
R2OD863L32JKI,It was perfect for what we needed it for!
R32GJTANLPS5U7,Looks very nice on top of our cast iron stove
R1YO843GJ09K9U,It was very difficult to tag items for the better
R1JV2AEYIP9WZY,good quality
R3SZ4M7VDAXRN8,easy install- it works---- but i would put another vent in the rear...
RH5IEG9W71U5G,It wasn't the right door we wanted .......wish it would of worked
R13T1PGR9S0LVF,"Made in China, what isn't.Looks like a damper, fit in my stove pipe, and was fairly easy to install."
RCROIZSZ14GU9,"I used these in a propane forge I built. The bricks cracked, warped and melted (!) the first time I used the forge. Maybe they're okay in a fireplace that only burns as hot as wood, but they are definitely not suitable for anything hotter."
R1I14GWVRXCFKU,Great set of stove parts
R325ZYVMY95AY4,okay
R39C2RU85PWU7Z,Made a really nice smoker easy assembly
R1G95G035GVTM6,I bought it as a Christmas gift for my sister-n-law to put on her original cast iron wood stove and she really liked it.
RKM8NW0B1FHQ,Works Great.
R2QERKD942OFXN,Great Quality!
R24056V9PGK0UX,Worked and custmer service was great
R1ETP9AO65OSA6,Everything was as expected.Would order again.
R3E0ZRBDUHWPA4,Everything was as expected.Would order again.
R1502VPS93DVCT,Perfect fit!! Better Then the original that came on the stove! Easy Hookup!
R23POFI0410K2S,Worked great
R1RQ0B599KBMT2,thought we needed two but one heats the whole house!
R12JX2LKDVQO64,Needs to be updated and issues fixed.. The slots on bottom are too small and don't let enough air in. I am now having to have thedoors open to get more air in the stove. Wire Handle broke off when trying to install it. It's cheap. Door pins are loose and need to be longer with some sort of pin on to hold them in. Door feel off when installing legs....I was flipping the barrel to drill holes for legs. The throat for the the chimney pipeneeds to be at least 1/2'+ longer/deeper.Also people need to realize and know to burn off the paint off the barrel to be bare metal. You dont want to be brething in the burn off from the paint or what ever was inside.
R15Y8RT8DOVU5Y,"The Damper is built well and installs easily.My only issue is it is a good 1/2"" smaller than the inner pipe diameter.I really wanted it to put right where my stove pipe exits the house, to keep cold air from coming down the flue when not in use.But it does help, and I can use it to slow down the rate of wood consumption.Overall a good product."
R3FUR7N2Y1KWGZ,Fits perfectly and seals when needed
R17HS3PYCG9HPJ,I bought this to replace the igniter in my mothers pellet stove. It lasted ONE DAY. I find no way to contact the seller without posting a negative comment here. Not impressed!
R2G42RLU2AXZBV,Works great for our maple syrup barrel we made.
R1XZZAHME5DY2A,great
R29BEUZO8QS0YR,No issues
R3LZY6RTG7V8YO,"Heavy cast iron, well made product. Easy to install with nothing but a sawzall and screwdriver."
R34YXLW7H5JCTQ,Perfect fit
RYWXLH0OECSX7,Fast delivery .very good deal
R1X4MTED54LKYH,OK good to go
R2XVYOEZMYP7SX,works good
R2A8JCJSFUOFR9,works good
R3UMNBHJWX91XV,"this picture is not what u get, this is some chinese craptempted to return but it is what i needjust be awaremy photo is what u get"
RB9JX2HGNSBBY,"Some years ago, before us Stove took over Vogelzang, we bought one of these and it was wonderful.Quiet and efficient. We bought our present reclaimer a couple months ago and you can easily hear that the fan is out of balance, a rythmic pinging sound.It is also otherwise much louder than the fan provided by Vogelzang.Big problem is the thermostat activates the fan sooner and runs longer than the previous model, causing the pipe to accumulate creosote much more rapidly.Not at all the same product.We may dump this and try a Magic Heat."
R1CCPST2H9E0BQ,"Great item, arrived quickly"
R2QHC9C0A6049K,Was what I was looking for
R1F6M9X60ZPGS8,Arrived without any broken pieces.It was as described and what I needed.
R25MI8XS0E02FB,"Its so small and cheaply made. Why do they sell stuff like this, that's such poor quality that it'll have to be purchased again next season?"
R2JFAVF50PLS3Y,great
R1GSGSGLY9YY3,"Product described just like said, worked perfect in my US Stove! Will order from again when I need more."
R2LIXH8G31Z169,greatful to get it
R290X2KE5H5RER,"Only 3/4 screws worked because the holes didn't line up, but three is plenty to hold it and that's my biggest complaint. Really helps heat the upstairs, which is noticeably colder with the fan off. Get this product if you want your woodstove to heat your house more evenly."
R3JEOU3E2VDZHA,We did everything it said to do and it is already warping.
R3NVMONC74CQOQ,Perfect fit.
RRLPEGWEZAMR6,Was a little disappointed that I had to replace my thermostat within 2 months of owning my brand new wood furnace and barely even using it. I hope it was just a flaw in the original one (solder let loose). So far this new one is working well. Shipping was fast.
R3CBSIFVG5LQVX,Just a tiny bit short but it worked out ok. I guess the heat will expand it.
R2B1WH8BIJOQ39,"Good quality, heavy"
R10T1USMLQDB8S,Works decently especially for the price
R2JMF98G7DN4BC,Fits good well made
R149CAZSDE4WBP,These stove fans really help your wood stove put out the heat. So much heat is wasted going up the stove pipe - no more!
R3P52ED4WHC5AW,Great!!
RT3VL3A2YJ60P,Great
R20YEQSFLOXXD3,Great
R1LQVBQBAH3J6L,So far it has not bubble up like the original one that came with stove.My stove is working the best it ever has.
R1R8EEYXJ2WR8Z,good
R2HMDK696G8N1K,What I needed
R31BY2GSZCGBLK,"We have a wood stove insert http://www.amazon.com/US-Stove-2200i-Certified-Fireplace/dp/B005RB2PUU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1455748006&sr=8-2&keywords=us+stove+insert (did not get from amazon, though). There were always a lot of chunks of charcoal in the ash so we wanted to try if adding some space under the wood will make the burn more complete. This grate fits the stove. Now pretty much all logs burned into ash in the morning. The down side is that the burn is so complete, we need to use log starter to get the fire to start again."
R2TIEZ9W9RDV8R,Fits an Ashely CAC without any problems.Great firebrick.
R192U0LIKLCKR,"Immediately upon heating up, this item gave off a strong, industrial-chemical odor.The last thing I want is something toxic-smelling that was made in China.As others have mentioned, it rusts astonishingly quickly - within a few hours.It is small, and this is exacerbated by the fact that the smallest diameter is the evaporation surface - the area that touches the heat source.Very poor design and possibly dangerous coating.I gave mine to a foundry."
R2YHOLS7RMHBJM,heavy duty
R2PZTIVMHLOPTR,heavy duty
R373XVS1YFI37N,Item works great so far. Mounting holes were slightly different but worked.
ROIW5BN8SMX0R,work well
R2HM2D429L5WGN,Get what you pay for
RRX9S0ZOEFH90,Awesome but pricy
R3TC2Z27TK9HVA,Great kit for a great stove. I'll be ordering more of these!
R3DJ0M07E3ZR9K,"Grate broke after 2 days of use, juke!"
R2Z9VCOIJG4MHF,Get the warranty!!!
R2QQ587K995DXM,Very small not full size
R19OGU1QPIXDJV,This is small. Wish it was larger.I have it on our woodstove and I constantly have to fill it up.
R3HDYO1XHUL2YI,"Other than being made in China which makes me dislike it immediately, it appears to be OK."
R32X69NB8C8KO0,This is my second Therm-O-Disc that lasted a whole two months before it stopped working properly.The first Therm-O-Disc came installed on the wood stove and that one lasted three months before it stopped working properly!
RXCY2X2Y0H5DA,works good but fan is extremely noisy
R3PJDDWRKZHPWQ,"It fit,it worked and it arrived on time."
RQ61D469MTGPP,Just what we needed
R7LIKJLU010HC,"I purchased this grate for an existing Vermont Castings Defiant wood stove. The fit was perfect. The only criticism is that the grate ""bowed"" from the heat of the fire (to be expected with the high temperatures of a wood fire). I really hoped it would last longer than one burning season. But overall, it does fit my stove and keeps the logs off of the bottom of the stove."
R3Q2XMJH2BARQN,Excellent blower that will also fit a Drolet stove.Barely can hear this blower run and has good output.
R36N918XCL8BNK,good
R3IMROMT3NM2UT,It rusts very quickly. We used bottled water. We finally painted it with Rustolium heat resistant spray paint to no avail. Nice looking ornament.
R2O1E11ETKM222,"It's a cast iron damper. It is made in China, so we'll see how durable it is, but it functions like it should."
R1MELNNRRPOS4K,Fit perfectly
RHYR4ZLR3P3CF,this fan is a must if u have a wood stove. before i purchased this i noticed that my back bedroom wasnt getting warm enuff. after i got this and used it one time i could tell a big difference. it attaches to the back of ur wood stove and blows heat out to warm the house evenly. i love it....u will to. been using it over a yr now and well worth the $ and shipping was fast.
R3O04DT067IQQ7,"Since it made by US Stove and they made the stove, I would think it would fit better,more like one size fits all."
R1UAZA2I66JM0G,Works well. Thanks!
R22C5AUYEJS349,"Absolutely the best. The improvement in the heat quality has been shocking unbelievable.My very old home (1890), and our 1864 cast iron, tower style wood stove obviously has many flaws. Less than a month ago, I purchased one. Easy too install. Within 3 hrs, the house had completely heated up... to the point that it was almost too much. Frequently the fire is let to run out... (grr/oops)..this heat reclaimer gets the house warm in under 3 hrs. From 41° to 74-76°, heating basement, first and second floor. Get it."
RG8016F726LVP,The item shipped on time. And was easy to install as well.
R3QVU3X2M2BUJP,"Okay, its cute but here's the problem.1.It's not level, some sort of manufacturing mistake where there is a ripple on the bottom of the pot so it does not sit level and rocks back and forth when you put water in it.So its unstable which makes it unsafe.2.It rusted... immediately.3.It's too small, have to add water every day.4.Is not adequate and does not put off enough moisture for anything other than the immediate area.Not happy at all with it"
R2B0HL0F5CNOGU,Great product
R3JCW6KETI9YPQ,An exact fit. Installation was flawless for me.
RX38XUNEVM3QK,Gets confusing.makes you think your getting a door with the kit
R3EGLVWL9NXE65,This damper has been so helpful for our family's fire place. My mom had no idea how reasonable the price was and that we could even get this part so thank you so much...
R3SV07GLB71SUE,Works Great!
R1YO5YCD4J2LRC,easy to install
R2OR1Z17SJTP2P,Loved it
R1M0ALOB6F97FT,"Easy installation, heats up my whole barn!!!"
R1CY1BA1LGF10H,When it worked it did pretty well but the thermostat in this thing is junk it turns on and off every few seconds then when I started inspecting it the themostat started arcing so bad the white porcelain on it was glowing blue should have bought the magic heat even though it cost twice as much
R2MPCQ5M2XGYNT,"easy to install, you can find barrels cheap on craigs list"
R1UEGXPEYC3I0B,My smoker work sweet. Love it.
R3MKWX4QA55KPX,"One is failing after a year and a half of use.It started to warp and now pieces are breaking off.In it's defense it has been used a lot.I live in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and we have long winters.I used it in my 1557M Hotblast furnace to replace broken shaker grates.I wish it would've lasted longer.I bought a pair, so we'll see how long the other one lasts."
R17YWQSERE9VRT,This was a recommended item for the Lil sweetie cast iron stove. This does not fit in the stove and is just a tad to wide. I ended up using it in an outdoor water drain since I couldn't just toss something this expensive.
R2QX3KVND1VT4,"Went together in short order, the parts seem to be of good quality. This will keep me warm in my shop!"
R1IMLLIM3J2ACL,"As advertised, fast service"
R2OMHFPZ0R6ZMX,"I was very happy to track this down. The price was right, as was the size.Overall, I""ve been pretty happy with it. I run my wood stove really hot sometimes, and this will bend a bit in the heat, but it's been no big deal."
RZUEZYCN690W9,fast and simple thank you
RGS56OJJL3104,Works well and helped with the nasty down draft while trying to start a fire in the wood stove. Seem well made.
R25YNS3CB2UIA1,"Simple to install and a fairly decent design. Out of the box it was a quite noisy. Upon pulling the cover (4 screws), I found that the fan blades mounted on the motor were of poor quality and had a substantial rattle due to the blades not being tightly pressed to the shaft fitting during manufacture.A substitute blade can be purchased on line from McMaster Carr. A 7 inch, 5 Blade fan blade designed to fit a 1/4 motor shaft drops right on. You'll need a screw driver to loosen the set screw on the old blade and a driver withe the appropriate size allen head to install the new blade. New blade is better quality, about 1/2 inch larger in diameter, and a 5 blade so it will push more air than the original.A relatively simple upgrade..."
RFO6RZC7PMRYW,holding up great after several hot fires in a repaired fireplace
R33A5HR30K85QI,Not worth the money when you pay 109 and only get 1
R2NLAHQTRJ00IR,Price has doubled in 2 years
RNXUGSL2F82B5,A lot smaller than expected.
R3ON24DT9DSWFV,"Really like it, smaller than what I thought but it did turn out to be just what I wanted."
R3RSLDKYHIZ7MW,It works good for what i want it to do.
R4KO7YELHY9GU,"I put it together this morning.I bought a brand new carbon steel barrel and in about 3 hours I had it completed.Tip;- after cutting and installing the front door and installing the front legs, do this- front legs are bolted in. door is on, now, set it down like a dog sitting, center the flue hole at the back endand cut it out, now you have access to the rear, and place it into place, and screw it tight.Now you drill for the rear legs, simply place the last iron legs under the stove, center it, level it, mark it.I used a magnetic torpedo level to make sure all 4 feet were level with the on end with the top facing upwards"
R3FPMJRNK7TA60,Well made and heavy duty product! Highly recommended!
RI6ISMLW8WZYC,Castings are in need of grinding to make fit around barrel better
R2VXHM80URE8DC,"Perfect fit, very satisfied with this product/seller."
R3BWP8QWL3DW0K,"I've edited my review because this product deserves more praise than I had originally given it.My husband, the carpenter, bought two barrels in order to construct a heating system for our 2400 square foot shop.The barrels were purchased used so we first burned them out thoroughly before using.Then he went to work placing one atop the other and did some minor adjustments for a flue, and fan blower..Winters are damp and cold here in South Carolina, believe it or not, and an all metal shop with concrete floors is no fun when you first open the doors in the morning.This system worked great, however.It kept the entire area sufficiently warm for working with woods and sealers.What a life saver."
R1V1JLTEWWI2NR,It did need some minor adjustments but it works fine.
RSW37W8343185,"Very easy to build. Put a centerline down the barrel to line up door, legs and flue. Cut hole for door as low as possible. Double check door placement before cutting. I used a sharpie to mark and a jigsaw to cut. Loaded up the wood to burn off chemicals and paint. Finished with high temp stove black paint."
R16NO39SU4QIW2,"This is a brick, it works like a brick."
R1XXT84LVKTAPY,"great item, reasonable pricing, fast shipping.This item allows the box stove to draw more air under the wood that is burning this increasing its ability to burn properly more than 50%"
RIBYMEDAIX1UM,As advertised. You better have some real metal cutting tools on hand for this task. Don't forget to get some high temp caulking to seal up the door frame and exhaust hole. ACE has it in their wood stove section. All good from here.
R2530H8H02W3B6,good
RDNEKUDWAP8T5,Excellent
R3B01DK1X77Q68,"I love this product but I wish it was actually complete. Yes I bought the bottom barrel too. The first time I bought the product I had to put a welded piece to hold the two apart because the brackets for in between the barrels wasn't included in my kit. I bought the kit this time because it appeared that the brackets were included in the double barrel portion but to my dismay they were not. Also it needs to say it needs the 3"" long 6"" wide piece to go inside the connection pieces so the smoke doesn't leak out. So yet again I have spend money on something expecting enough pieces...... It is a good thing I'm so inventive. Love the product and the idea but wish it were complete."
R1ZR9VZGTBXQJH,I think they could have molded it a little better.
R3MZ7DWBDELMH6,"Good Kit, worked out very well and easy to install."
R3PNH8SJBJ4GZ9,Grates are junk I have been through 3 grates over two burning seasons. Each time the grate deteriorates in the center and sags down into the ash pan. Save your money find a different stove. US Stove Company also has bad customer service.
RRO2CHDJBFRKI,Satisfied
RV3ODOU65CMCS,Just what I wanted!Good product !!!
R210IX1BNMAVHP,Works As Described. I have several wood burning stoves and usually what fails on these dampers is the spring gets weak (loses temper) and the damper no longer stays in position. I wish I could just buy the spring and rod.
R2IIOS15YJYFSU,Nice quality product.Heavy duty which should last for years.
R1IK57JRO8COWX,Castings had to be ground down to make them fit properly
RU2LDS0X8GN9X,"exactly what I expected, although a little hard to assemble in the wood burner as they are heavy. Actually has to get inside wood burner to install and got stuck! HAHA"
R2028OKT954OL,Product fit nice and snug. Well made
R3B6CH4WGPLR82,"Had to cut to size, but works like it should.One of the six was broken upon delivery."
R3GQ63Y270WQ13,Arrived quickly- priced right - as described- does what it's suppose to do.
RZ4GOPAZK1RMP,Works very well.
RYC1PT8U2C34H,I use these for my jewelry making soldering station. They make me feel safer.
R1BKJ42ADTQQR,is ok
R26KFGKB0Y6JPO,"This little guy holds 3 cups of water comfortably, 4 cups would be overflowing the lip for the lid.As a potpourri steamer it is a great size, but using as a water steamer on a wood stove, it would not hold enough water (as a steamer) to last the night if the stove was really hot.But I really like the country rustic design and it looks great sitting on my wood stove.I'll just add a larger pot steamer to the stove top for function and not design."
R11UQBCMP08J08,"This product failed to meet any expectations. It rattled until the fan fell off and you cannot use it unless it is plugged in, which would render it useless in a power outage. It is made with extremely thin metal which will not last. Do not waste your money!"
R2631FBAFNCXEX,"Total crap, stay away from us stove, golden eagle, and breckwell, all made by this crappy company. For all you people with burn pot problems put a straight edge on the front of your stove. You will see why you have airleaks (look at my photo)Fyi my first stove was so shoddy the sent me a replacement, and the replacement is total garbage as well. Plan on spending 200$ in parts every heating season.I have never wrote a review before but I hate the 5500m so much I had 2.RUN AWAY!! for the love of god do not buy this stove!P.s I am thinking about reporting us stove to the BBB"
RDOYK6OHUEQ3Z,"baffle works well, very timely shipping, like the price too.Will definately continue shopping online."
R3W4OVHGKMV048,Way overpriced. I paid 39.99 each. I bought them at the store which I purchased my burner.
R2EFC86QO312P0,"over priced. I went to the store where I bought the stove and paid $59.95 for each grate. Plus, for the price of these things you would think they would last much longer. I only get about 2 - 3 seasons out of these."
R2Z73P3QWHU520,It gets rusty in no time :-/It's cute but it's way to small to be used as a humidifier.Maintenance is no fun.
R25A5SQ0EQS6N8,"Wrong size as advertised. Disappointed, returning product."
R210KNOIGBD9XK,"Fast shipping, much cheaper price than other places. Exact fit and works as it should."
R366K62GKI9K8J,"The construction is excellent. The only problem I see is,I should have ordered the small one. It's too big. I looked for dimensions, but could not find them. Will have to reorder the small one."
ROMYS7UZ5WR8E,A must for any boxwood stove.Makes clean out easier and allows air to circulate. Get one!
R2IPIFG7NLQIBW,thanks
R2O59G0H1EGLI,Thank you so much! They are exactly what we needed to keep us warm this winter.
R1SYA5UNSABGKU,"Outstanding!!,I will mod the wires with Heat wrap .It looks and feels well built."
R2NWKWS2B63BJR,"First package received had no cement.The replacement came with a tube of RTVBlack, Silicone rubber adhesive sealant.Not the type of cement shown.Brochure states ""withstands temperatures up to 1000 degrees, F.Tube of sealant gives temps as -85 to +500 degrees, F.We will see if it will last."
R1KLHLY73WJLAP,"This worked well for about 3 months, then the wiring melted and shorted to the unit itself ! DANGEROUS ! I was not home, but my girlfriend was, and she smelled it burn up and saw sparks, so thankfully she unplugged the unit... *** PRODUCT IS NOT UL LISTED EITHER *** . I feel this unit cannot be left alone, Nor Trusted to be Safe... It does not work well without the fan blowing (obviously). In theory this would be wonderful, In practicality, I feel it to be Dangerous. Cannot, and will not recommend. And, judging by the very similar issues/reviews here, I was not alone in my experience with this Item. I've been using woodstoves for 30+ yrs, and know how to properly run a stove, so, I can say ,it was NO fault of mine that this product failed. After an E-mail to the company I was told it was out of warranty. Terrific !!, and not un-expected."
RGEHIVYCQOG2Q,Maybe put a real handle on door
RGVVI9CUM4JBM,It would be nice if holes aligned with with the stove pipe adaptor when going from single barrel to a double barrel
R2I0JPC09QUTIW,"I couldn't tell what I was getting for sure- hardbrick or softbrick. I ordered this product twice, about 2 weeks apart. The first time I got structural bricks, each about 3lbs 14oz, whiter, no visible pours, one side smooth, the other with small ridges. The second time I got a brick that is more gray, porous, each brick weighs about 2lbs 3oz. I don't have the box from the first shipment to see if the part # was actually listed different on the shipment, the second shipment the box says part # 85848E. Looking at responses to questions (where I also left this info), others seem to have gotten different things, too. It would be nice to list a weight and if this is hardbrick (structural) or softbrick (insulating). And yes, softbrick is still hard, it cracks with a hammer and would hurt your head if you got smacked with it."
R3B59OYYLTKNF7,Ideally. Like.
RLFG1CDOCDDTG,Damper had problem with 'spring wire' wrapped around handle upon delivery... did not notice until installed - to late to mention and we use gloves at the stove so we should no get burned...
R3DE5JG0DA0FF3,Exact part needed and decent shipping time.
RFZEO59SKME3I,Good product for a great price.
RAMG7797T4IFX,"The paint came off after second third time of using it. On the second time i heard "" shot and door cracked because of the heat. I was only burning leafs."
R3CI33UEV1BIIY,I like the idea of it. But my legs were a little messed up. Didn't sit flush to the barrel. The 2 barrels won't attach like in the photo. I must be missing a center collar or something.
R3TKQTX4ZHBV7M,great came on time excellent!!!
RKQL1IO2BYNTJ,"Good quality baffle, this one lasted longer than the original. We've been getting over 2 years of service before they start to warp. They're hard to find sometimes, especially during the burning season. Keep a spare on hand."
R38GL956AI6UR,"Fifty percent were broken; half bricks, half sand."
R3QYHZX5OJZZCZ,Works as advertisedwithout much difficulty to install.
R2L0B2ZK6NQS1U,put in stove pipe and tested seams to work fine the real test will be this winter when its forty below.
R16FKCEXA2KTAQ,Nice little potpourri steamer for a woodstove.
RLG9ANNFCNLLN,Using on the wood fire heater to keep humidity levels normal
R376W5Y72U34TR,HAPPY WITH IT
RDU3QEYPTF0C8,We have looked everywhere for these. They fit the barrels perfectly. They are made well and look nice.
R36RLZBYZSCKX1,perfect for my needs very nice
R3E466RXNH6RLT,Garbage
R2CGJNJCSQ5S3H,Replaced an old burnt out one - fits the pipe fine
R8OXL7FQXSKBA,"Buy these if you like the ""look"" but not because you want to humidify your home. We have a wood burning steel fireplace insert. It gets hot enough on the top portion that extends beyond the face of the fireplace to inflict a nasty burn but the water evaporation rate is still pretty low; maybe a couple of inches of water in an evening. It takes quite a while just to heat up the cast iron hen and water. Starting with hot water helps a little. Note also that the hen MUST be well ""seasoned"" like cast iron cookware if you want to avoid rust."
R1442SH4D8W8VG,"Good heavy fire bricks, three of six broken on arrival."
R2URR2ICR11ZGK,Everything in this kid came as described and is well-made with the exception of the hardware. The screwswith this kit are complete junk! They are a really poor quality steel and the Phillips head stripped out and almost everyone! I had to go to Lowe's and pick up replacements for three or four buck$.
R1LHMMGDL4YLAG,i liketi
R1D7YU0UYVBRLC,"Great bricks, came package great and none were broken!"
R19PEZFL2ZHL2P,"Got two sets (12 bricks total) to fill up my Traeger Texas Elite.A few small chips when the arrived, but nothing bad since they were going into a grill.My have gotten around 40 degrees higher on high temp cooks (I had problems with the grill itself over 325 degrees...was tough to get it to 400), but now I can do my 350 cooks no problem).I still should be able to get higher according to the controller, but that's another story.Low cook temp was around the same, but I'll have to monitor pellet use.""Seems"" better, but I'll have to do some long familiar ones before I know for sure."
R25KJO5OPYQT4G,These were a perfect replacement for our woodstove.It is so much more efficient with them all in place again.
R3AY8EYB97FRTU,The hen is cute and looks good on my pellet stove
R1Y2LTE8BU1G7E,"It was considerably smaller than expected, and when you add the water it goes all ""rusty"" on the inside.Considering the cost of the freight must say I was disappointed.Looks cute on the fire though! Had been going to purchase another for a friend, but wont now."
R3EEO1C7DJ3W84,They look like the right thing. Haven't used them yet :)
R1P582IRZ55RJO,rusts after afew uses
R3LUP3MFKXMC59,Much smaller then I thought it would be.
RXYAHJ53T9FKS,a few were broken around the edges.But they still work.
R23Y9NSBR7Q0JO,"These firebricks probably would have been useful, except that when they arrived half of them were broken, so they were returned."
RPJ08L24WZUP4,Chipped up a little
R1VSIANW13ADRA,Good product. Was a perfect replacement on my wood stove.
R3NJIO21UM5XR8,"Wonderful replacement for my fireplace.I figured since the old bricks were cracking it was an indication I should replace them.They arrived fast, in one piece and were simple to install."
R2AD7GH42ATZAP,Worked well for our needs and looks good on the stone chimney.
R18CRLF0057GPX,great price but better off getting at the store. Lot of broken bricks in shipping.
R1VUUFAPWWO6L3,Got this to replace our rusted pellet stove blower. the original was a different name but this was a perfect fit. Took my husband a half hour to replace. There was a smell when we first used it as it burned off the greases they use when assembling it but it went away after a few days.
R33XB79JSDPTRX,It seems cheap. Got me through the heating season. I would have expected being US stove co. it would be made in the US. Sadly this is made in China. Wish I could have found something made in the US.
RINCXFUSI6YPM,"casting is messed up we had to chip out some of the holes in the feathers or there wouldn't be any area for steam. Then re-painted. Frankly, It was a mess and not good quality at all."
R3IAAZDCGBPJ4C,Exactly what a friend said it would be--I'm happy.
RGIND9L7RKGBK,"Not what I expected, after seeing the BK100 kit. It took some modification to even make it work properly."
R1D12NCVI1QERD,Works perfectly
R162FCZSLBJOW0,Came right to the door. Worked great!
R25X556ODV2UK3,most bricks arrived broken.
R10B05IBUXTV1W,"I ordered this thinking the kit in the picture would be what actually came in the mail. Unfortunately the United States stove company manufactures their kits in China, go figure. Jagged unfinished edges, and china stamps on every piece are a big turn off. Other then that it functions and does its job.My opinion though go with the volgezang."
R1GWZ84MAQ5ELN,Fit perfectly
R2UDFDPUDTLH7H,It worked out very nice.
RO33OF9ECZIEI,Replacement fit was good and they held up very well after my 1st full burn this season .
R2BZYOIB05G4JG,great service & product
R7IWW2RVXWRA9,Perfect fit!
R3R0SIVB4UY79I,Received it quicker than projectedgreat product.
RJCLNRECFJJL4,I bought this king pellet stove at local tractor supply for $1000. Then another $200 for exhaust kit. Then $50 more for fresh air intake. Then $50 for fire safe mat. Then I had to buy some extensions that matched the kit at $20 a foot. Price is not the problem with this stove.I have had this stove installed for one week and have already vaccumed it once and it needs it again. So it needs to be vacuumed every four days.It burns more than one bag of pellets in 24 hours on its lowest setting. I have it in a 1080square foot mobile home and at °10 to °40 it is like a sauna in here. Much better heat than propane. I have had it smoke up my living room once like the guy showed on you tube. That only happens if you keep turning it on and off though.
R1TBO17AD65WBG,just what i wanted works great
R32AI5DODEDBX0,Item was perfect..works great..quick shipping..thank you
R3R3TGG8KJZUNI,Ordered this item twice and both times bricks arrived broken and not usable.
RRNL4JO9O7EQS,Very happy qith it.
R3OJD8PNNTT3M1,EASY TO ASSEMBLE
R8HEOJKOPNIOH,It has run quiet and has been a good replacement for our previous blower.Installation was easy and all the holes lined up.Zero problems.
R39WBDJIA55NNW,"When the blower kicks on it is obnoxiously loud. The screen rattles and so far, we haven't found a way to quiet it down. If it wasn't such a pain for us to get it on with the pipes in the first place we would have sent it back. We had a heat reclaimer just like this before and it wasn't noisy at all."
R2U83TPIXWQNGW,great heat for the greenhouse
R29UP95WC93WUJ,Feel it's really helped with heating our home.
R1FUNVNKS4GUNJ,Product works but didn't fit properly
R1ASN0I2CQBWYG,"Works beautiful,no issues at all"
R26ERFEH7DTMFY,very happy with the product and good price
R2U4P6NX65R7G2,"very well made,"
R35NHZ909GZ8X8,Just smaller then I thought.
R250TKJDNGYA23,"Good service, good fit, terrible price."
R2BZ1QCZYQK24T,I'm on my second stove in one year. The first one was riddled with problems. It only worked for 1 week then just stopped. Their customer service is friendly but doesn't seem to care. They had me completely rebuild my first stove by sending me all of the replaceable parts inside of it one by one until they decided that the stove was just a lemon. They finally agreed to replace the stove and that took 3 months to finally get the replacement. The replacement stove worked perfectly for 2 months and then the auger broke. I just today received the parts to fix it. I just cant believe how bad the quality is on these American made stoves.
R3HQ8LB3YX4J98,"This kit was fine but there are little differences that make not as good as the competition.I purchased US Stove andVolgalzang at the same time to compare them.US Stove works fine, but it is not as nice as the Volgalzang.Not bad but not impressive"
R2F4RY0A7RVRGV,"Work fine, not much to say about them"
R2ZSCOTT8BJCLB,Smaller than expected.
R1UBDJ722E9PXX,works great but would have moved door up past small plug
R113MOW5NVS0SZ,works great
R2OBTU19RJR8Z2,she is small but cute
R9672WCHJVNGQ,I bought this pellet stove 3 yrs. ago-what a money pit it is.I have replaced-the exhaust blower motor-circulation motor-high limit switch-low limit switch-auger motor-front bay door insulation-US stove sells the parts at a huge mark-up-The stove is noisy-malfunctions all the time-and a genuine piece of crap-undependable and waste of money-I would not recommend this stove to my worst enemy-live in Maine
RE2BP2EF7261X,Arrived intact and works as it should
R2D98DRW1U1DO7,"Arrived quickly,and looks nice."
RZF3LWUXOL97N,"Junk grates, I also have been through 3 of them in the last 2 years. The 3rd one I have already scrapped, here is 2 of the 3.J U N K ! I have been burning Coal for over 40 years, and never had this kind of problem out of Grates until now.I contacted customer service via email at US Stove Company,to get ignored."
R3PXF9TM6TI5UF,Used heavily in a small stove this winter and haven't had any warping or cracking issues.
RBP0TBT8TV6MC,It was just what are pellet stove needed glad I can get parts off Amazon
RSFF8U7WTEXUN,Perfect fit for my wood stove and does the job nicely.
R3ROFOJWOS6P6O,Don't buy this stove. I've had this stove for three years. First year had to replace the blower motor three times. They just die. I bought the stove to save money on gas. It uses about a bag and a half a day. Two bags + on high. At the price of pellets its just the same to use the gas furnace.The blower motor is very noisy on medium and low speeds. Have to shut the stove down every day to clean the fire pot or else the pellets back up.It also blew soot through out the house. You can see black soot on my white ceiling. Didn't use this stove the second year. Now the third year I'm trying to use it again and now after burning six bag of pellets the blower motor again quit. I wish I could dump this Chinese piece of junk on US Stove's front door. Again DON'T BUY THIS STOVE!!!!!
RMASHE2GGEBCE,shipping was very fast BUT the box had been torn open and tape back BUT there was no hardware in the box. As heavy as the product is it really needs to have a much heavier box for shipping and I think the legs should be a lot taller sets to low to the ground so I will be putting two sender blocks under each end.
R1IHSQBR984B5X,Very good product
R1IBC1Z5JDERKG,Performed as expected.I would recommend this product.
RA1MGVY4RPGEN,"Works fine, perfect fit"
R19JVUFSAH9ZUT,Works great so far! Had it for almost one winter in MS.
RSBR8XJVDUGGI,"I have a very oddly designed 80's era fireplace in one level of my home.It has vent tubes that run under the burning wood which then curve upward and to wall to disperse the heat.The issue is that thee are large gaps in these and material falls everywhere and creates as mess.I purchased these bricks with the intent of laying them out to give me a flat, continuous surface to build my fire on.That plan was fine, the issue was with the product itself.I ended up receiving and then returning 3 packages of these bricks because each package had every single brick broken.I never once got a pack that didn't havebricks that were either broken into multiple pieces, broken in half, or chipped and crumbling all around the edges.I understand that these bricks are brittle by nature and they are not designed to be extremely strong, but they were all so destroyed that I could not make them work at all.Seems that it might be a packaging/shipping/handling issue rather than a product manufacturing issue.I ended up seeing a long string of returns in my future so I went another route to solve my problem.On a positive note Amazon's returns were always easy and free of charge!I gave the product 2 stars because I know some reviewers have gotten lucky and received their bricks intact.As I stated above, the problem is not with the product manufacturing but rather the shipping causing them to break.They would have worked fine if I had received them intact."
R1UEDK4LVKDVKH,good
R31GIRJUKB85F4,"The kit does work and it heats my 25' x 40' outbuilding. The smoke stack casting are good and at the proper angle. How ever the leg castings angles do not mate well with the barrel curves on the 55 ga drums. I had to shim with washers to get the fit closer.U S Stove should take a look at this.My kit came with 10mm hardware. All the nuts and bolts were fine, no problem. Add lockwashers on the inside,this will aid tightening of the fasteners. Take your time and plan your work. I used an air saw with a 32 cutting blade. Adding cutting oil helps the blades last longer. . The kit is far cheaper than fabing one yourself. I'm using a box fan to move air over the stove. Enjoy the warm heat."
R1FF3R3IFQW6TX,fan not big enough
R1QVNHAY0A9QA4,It works great
R138MBU5FLGRIV,"Good replacement bricks for my Harman Wood Stove.None were broken when received, but it doesn't look like the packaging method was changed from what other reviewers who received broken ones had described.I will update if they don't last long."
R13BCNDA8ZR3MB,It could be built to mold around a barrel better. Honestly only good for the front shoot rest is china junk but I guess that's all they sell now a days
R1999AJFETZSCU,Great stove if you know how to care for it. I usually take mine apart every 2-3 months oil the bearings clean the dust and tighten everything. My stove is an 2008 which has the older pcb which isnt actual crap. I have replaced the igniter and it functions great. Only thing i wish this model had is an ash pan.
R2ZG05Z1P9F7GQ,Perfect finishing touch
R18NYVLP8MVM3H,This was for my brother's stove and he reports there were no problems installing it and it works exactly as it states.He said he was surprised at the heat that it put out into the room.
R1BXDHCABBGA6H,"Not good, the first one came in incorrect causing the control panel to fail. Not only did I have to buy a new control panel I have to buy a new auger motor."
R26V6U3RS3DDJM,Makes you wonder
R2SQQG3TLY0OYS,It was here on time with t he stoveIt all good
R23KH46K5D9BZX,Was very satisfied with the part and how quick it was delivered
RAEN14P8RSO6K,Works great
R2YS51RI1FTG7E,Had to modify it because the barrels wouldn't sit flat and line up.. I expected better quality for the price
R2DQVZNZSOIZJT,Works great. Started to rust within 24hrs. No instructions came with it
R23D5WBQJLNY7H,"warped after 1 month of use, cheap material.Dont know where to find one that fits of better quality.Here i am buying another grate only because there is no option.Junk grates,don't even last a year!Gonna have to start looking for a different stove i guess."
R35KAWCUPYC05E,"Works great, throws the heat, keeps the room very warm."
R3FW8AU1406X4F,I have been burning wood for thirty years and I have never seen a product that doesn't hold up the stove is back up to cold weather and the ashes are kept way down but the grates don't hold this is my third grate and the stove is going! I need a dependable stove and this one is costing me
R2YZT1F888LEY0,"I have six of these double stoves here in California.I use one in my house and it is super cost efficient during the fall and winter months. The others are in our backwoods rental cabins. These work great and are a great way to rid the forest if deadwood around camp. The tree huggers don't seem to care about the ""pollution nor the envirocops. Excellent product all around!"
R3MRJK88CE4Y5Y,"Using on a gas stove to humidify the room, adding spices and citrus and adds wonderful smells to the kitchen."
R3F60XXPUCOW4S,"This is miracle heat reclaimer number two, I hope this one last just as long.we had it for around 6 yrs.this one circulates well,runs quiet.well worth the price."
R1B3G1458JOU82,Works as advertised.
R2AO7RQZ8ZJLF,"Read the details, don't trust the image. Product comes with a lot less than expected based off of the image. I recognize that I could have done more research but I still fill a little deceived. Product worked well but is not flawless"
R2F2XJ7EOPM8BV,Christmas gift for my husband's stove in his shop.It works great so far.
R2LG9U7EQT0QSO,"I've owned this stove for 4 years.....RUN AWAY....VERY FAST, VERY FAR !First Heating Season:Heated well, no issues except an extraordinarily loud room (convection) fan...relegating this unit to the downstairs family room.Second Heating Season : Igniter failed midway through season, replaced at a cost of $75.....Noticed a MASSIVE increase in my electricity bills in the months following ($120++ per mo. increase over normal).....after a bit of investigation, discovered that the igniter was not switching off when startup cycle had run it's course -- meaning the igniter was on continuously except for an hour a day when I would be forced to vacuum the ashes. This forced me to install a switch to cut off the power to the igniter after the startup cycle concluded....Pain in the A** additional step of operating this unit..Third Heating Season : Igniter AGAIN failed (probably due to the continuous use the prior heating system), Replaced once again at a cost of $75. Midway through season, volume levels of room (convection) fan increased dramatically (think turboprop vs. jet engine).....investigate, bearings on convection fan failed -- another $190 down the drain to replace fan. With 3 weeks left of the heating season left, noticed noise level of the convection fan once again beginning to increase dramatically....Fourth and FINAL heating season : During the summer, during the standard maintenance of the unit, I removed the convection fan again, and chose to replace the bearing on the fan, rather than shell out another $190. Ordered new bearings from the original manufacturer of the fan and installed. Problem solved, you think ? Not a chance - three weeks into the heating season, bearing failed, causing the stove to overheat and the pellets in the hopper to overheat and begin to smolder....What, no safety precautions from the stove manufacturer that would prevent this kind of safety hazard ?NOPE ! Well, long story short, replaced the bearings on the fan once again......and once again, the bearings failed a month down the road....THIS time, there was more than a few pounds of pellets in the hopper...this time causing quite the conflagration. Nope, I had enough with this stove.This stove is a death trap...simple as that...no safety features....YOU WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN !Avoid this stove like the plague !Not to mention the other bad points about this stove.........parts are EXTREMELY expensive, the noise levels of this stove(even at it's best) was unacceptable,..it is extraordinarily difficult to clean and maintain (I looked like a chimney sweep at every cleanout)...never again !"
R3AJJ8JO7SU13Z,"It's small and holds a small amount of water.No instructions with it, but it is safe to add water while it's still hot."
R1JRCAX7NHZPJ3,perfect fit works great!
R1WWFX3ZRD9J89,"Bought this for my sons pellet stove, smaller than I thought but very cute! The inside does rust quick quickly."
R1U6STP10J50OE,I highly recommend buying this product. We received the stove kit within a couple days instead of the couple weeks per our estimated delivery date. The box wasn't dinged up and everything was in great shape. We even got the dapper with the kit which was a bonus because we didn't see that listed. We can't wait to get the stove put together. Thanks!!
R2IUL8G7KRRQP0,"I recently installed one for my brother in law...which was purchased for much less at Tractor Supply....so far so good...Although you can ""direct Vent"" straight out I recommend buying an install kit and running a few sections vertically to creat some natural draft and to avoid backup during a power outage..Also run the fresh air vent to the outside.....the unit burns very clean and puts out some nice heat...However I think heating 2000 sq ft is a stretch....Big hopper,and easy to clean...just push the brush handle in and out and empty the ash drawer...Other,more extensive cleaning is required....follow the instructions.....As a former HVAC business owner I noticed the vent and blower motor along with the negative pressure switch are the same as those used for gas furnaces and should give good service.....We'll see...Just keep it clean.....The blower automatically adjusts speed according to the thermostat setting but can be set to high for all settings.....You can hear the fan and the flame is bright......I was amazed how the glass stayed so clean...no soot....I would of given it a 5 but it's made in China...."
R5638SSG4IEFJ,Great way to get more heat from my wood stove.
R2W7ME1GCDE66L,Intalled perfectly
R14C9W27W59X1F,"Great product, great idea. Would recommend to anyone. It does take a little time to get it installed correctly. Love this product."
R2686QLYTKYN91,Fit right in my stove and was ready to go in minutes!
R2VBD97TZ2B1JS,"I have had my stove going on 3 years now.The only problem I have ever had is the burner pot clumping up with burnt pellets.This requires a quick cleaning (tapping burn pot against chassis) and its good to go for another bag.Now, I have tried several different brands of pellets and found some do not clump as bad as others.Other than that, if you don't keep the two fans clean (2 a season) you can get a decent vibration that makes an annoying sound.Also, go to Tractor Supply, I bought mine for around 900 or so."
R1FYEA1Y5O0I34,Doesn't work very well. Legs are Avery bad fit for a 55gal drum.. Decided to not use after all the trouble. Did not consider it safe.
R37X124MMQ7T7S,Cute little rooster to sit on your wood stove. It does not hold much water so you will need a large cast iron pot as well.
R31F55LHDULMUV,Just what we needed.
R3B43TCKPQUPDR,very good at keeping our place warm would deffinately buy it again. easy to install and a very cheap way to warm a place. we have ours in our flat and it heats the entire place with no problem.
R1HF3RELJWX5GL,After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical but decided to go with this set anyway.I was not disappointed.My new double barrel stove keeps my boat shop nice and toasty and the kit was perfect.I would definitely buy this again.
R1227171JEG3Y,"A leg was broke upon arrival. Another leg was severely warped. Did not fit barrels well. Thought I was ordering the best barrel stove kit there is, regardless of price. I was wrong, poor quality."
R1F78CPAB74CQ0,works great
R1O3J3KX8JRCCB,It was 1 degree F. last night. This sure helped it being 70F inside.
R36QC1G3A9026F,"works very well , better than what I could purchase locally. had to alter the opening slightly on the baffle to bolt it on the stove."
R2BHV4ADSIH53Z,Extremely disappointed with this item.This item can not be used as described and pictured unless attended to as it it far to small to hold enough water to make it through the night.This should be noted in the description.We were not interested in it as a decorative piece or door stop.$10 to ship it back is equally disappointing.Shameful Amazon!
R3HG3ZFQIF8A1L,"These Firebricks are much more dense and heavy than I had anticipated however, they appear to be quite sturdy. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I was expecting bricks that were a bit more porous and easier to cut down into desired angles, but I do think they will work just fine with a bit of elbow grease. But overall, they seem to be good quality; I have only taken one out of the box at this point, so if I find anything to the contrary once I set up my studio, I will update this review."
R2Q64CPYN0VPDJ,Had the bottom barrel and needed more heat for the barn.. Ordered the adapter kit and installed it without any problems... removing the flue from the bottom barrel to place it on top was a bit of a problem as the screws were difficult to remove... bought new screws and it was a snap... You will need to cut a short piece of chimney pipe to connect the two barrels... been using it for several weeks now... works as expected.
R2DJLAGDI2EN8W,Been useing it for 4yr know as are main heat in are old houes we run about 4tons of pellet in it a yr. the only thing that has not worked wright on ithas been the self igniter i put 2 new ones in with in the first yr. after the 2nd one went out i just started useing some stater gel and have just stuck with doing it that way. I love the large hopper it will let me go 2 or 3 days with out refilling it.
R3KM03TY7WUFXE,What a perfect size for a small wood stove.It fits perfectly and frees up the kitchen saucepan.Plus it looks very nice!
R2ICD1XGTM09HL,just like factory new.
R1F14BUGDR6RWV,"These arrived in perfect condition, I put them in my fir pit over sand to make cleanup a breeze"
R2CWEAPX60SP7Z,Arrived broken
R9G0BIMT5ZT1T,This lasted a little over 2 seasons....after the one year it started collapsing down....so be prepared to buyanother in this time frame. I don't use my stove every day and since I'm in California it's a short season!
R1A8COSEBY4H5T,Love it came in quick and it is well built
RUR2BE0PIJNN2,Arrived on time with all Bricks intact.
R12NX5WUV42DKE,Arrived poorly overpacked but unlike many of the reviewers all bricks are intact
R2N9TB20CLB5L2,"I used this exact kit to build a barrel stove outdoor furnace used to heat my home from the outdoors! So far I have been heating my home using wood I get for free. The kit is really awesome. Since this is outdoors, I can be reckless and burn pine, soft woods, and other non-toxic BUT burnable woods! If you want to see how I built it, check out the pics: [...]"
R336VCL67F1DKN,"Couldn't wait for it to come...we were replacing an old one. This certainly is the quietest reclaimer yet. Best of all, the price was great too!!!"
R6LWYR0RT215E,have not made it yet
R1A136WPV0G27P,"Haven't installed it yet, but looks to be well built. Will update review after instillation."
R1B485Q9NIZNZ1,Just the right size for what I needed at a good price.
RHN0TAE6H6B0K,"Good product, clean bends, easy assembly, heavy duty metal. It fit onto my Englander 28-3500 but was a tight fit."
RJPMNEA3MJ4QD,"4 out of 6 of these bricks were broken upon delivery. There was no protection at all during shipping. Some were merely cracked in half, while others were basically shattered. The fragments perform as expected under heat, but it would be nice to have whole bricks to lay down instead of my make-do fire brick mosaic."
R2TSE5279EAII3,"Works perfect, keeps my garage warm"
R12W6G6367AI1,"I find it to be excellent in everything except an automatic on off sensor.This,is 2014. Not to have that capability is so last century."
R265Y8X89XE18R,"Just a heads up for anyone buying this for a US Stove 5500M.I have an older type unit with 3 control buttons.The part number 80472 that I was lead to believe I was buying for $255 actually arrived as part number 80472A.This was listed elsewhere on Amazon for $190.I ordered the one without the A because that was the exact part number for my stove, and I saw in other reviews that the A model had an extra plastic cooling fan.So, the new motor arrived and I got ready to install, and was already mad that I got suckered into spending $60 more for a model I didn't get and I see that the mounting holes are different.No, problem - I'll just drill out new holes so it will mount on the stove.That's when I noticed that the motor is on the wrong side of the fan housing.Holding it up where it should be mounted shows the motor would need to stick out past the side panel.No way to mount any other direction; pellet hopper is in the way on the other side.So this required moving the unit over and blocking part of the air opening where the fan mounts.Had to mount with new self tapping screws.Watch out - the motor blocks one mounting hole, so you need to tap that one first and then install it with a wrench.The unit actually works okay once you get it installed.Speed control works fine.Not a job for someone who is not handy.THIS IS NOT A DIRECT BOLT ON REPLACEMENT.THEY ARE NOT SELLING THE 80472 PART.Would have returned, but needed to get my stove working which was out for 5 days."
R2Z7MRW4LHIDML,Was delivered today. Seems like its well built. Very heavy. Now I just have to find a barrel. Nobody in my area has any available. I counted all the nuts and bolts and actually got two of each extra. Found out after I bought it that I cannot put it in my garage..but I have other plans I can do with it.
R1OH0H9DM846UM,It rusts when I use it.It doesn't do what it says.
R1SG2JE17PEYFO,Used to make our 55 gallon ovens
R1WE8VIBR25FJQ,haven't tried yet . fit stove ok will Know more in near future
R1ROO9G803PXUH,This works well.
R34V971151PGUY,"Exactly as described, does the job it was intended to do."
RJUL669PXIRXT,good kit will buy again
R3JCZ9XS0P0T13,"cheap, you look at it wrong and it breaks in half"
R1QURD7IU6YEHQ,good quality arrived on time
R1L7C0RH3PGRXU,"It does put out a lot of heat and does not take a large fire to get the metal hot.I did have to cut a larger hole under the door to get enough air to the fire.For some reason the fire went out just a few seconds after I closed the door, but then again I have little to no draft up the pipe.Still working on what will work best.This procedure may not be needed for most people.I have my stove mounted in the fireplace using the chimney for the smoke.The kit did go together well, I used a metal wheel on a hand grinder to cut the openings. Just lay the door where you want it and chalk the inside the door for a guide line, (there are no patterns with the kit.).. It is exactly as stated.Figure to spend a few hrs. on the assembly to do it right. Also, take the damper apart so you can get your hands in to hole the nuts to tighten them down, then install the damper in the hole."
R6Y99O9XRUCX5,Delivered as described and performs as expected.
RUKF7KVCXLQN0,Quality product.
R2K5NGA1MPZW9N,Exactly what I needed to replace several broken bricks!
R1LB11VQQ1FAOR,"Purchased this for 3 wall, insulated, stainless steel pipe and my very old sierra wood burner. Drilled holes and installation was easy (I just had to remove the spring because of the thickness of the pipe). WORKS GREAT!!! Less heat going out the chimney and more in the house. Loading the burner and the wood lasts longer. WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT AND TIME!!! Just have to get used to opening the damper BEFORE opening the door ... Cloud of smoke!!! The handle could be a little larger, it gets hot some times ... so wear gloves ... should anyway when working with a wood burner."
R2W1EJ0LBQ7MA9,Great product.Thanks
R1KVHEZYO83PUL,"Bought one 3 years ago. Went thru 2 igniters the first month. don't try to remove from the back, cut the wires and push it thru the front and it will come out with the swelled end toward the front it won't get stuck in the holding tube! US stove didn't answer any correspondence about warranty issues on igniters.(SHAME ON YOU FOLKS) bought them both out of pocket, IT WAS WINTER AND NEEDED HEAT. I just use propane torch to start pellets now. Much cheaper! No problems since I took care of it myself. Never did hear from U.S. Stove. Stove is very loud. Would suggest HI volume low speed instead of HIGH speed low volume. Got to give it a 3 because it has been great since the igniter issues and the $160.00 out of pocket issue. Nice deep hopper is a plus. Would have given it a 4 if they had backed up their warranty. Warmth is wonderful---good product---would be great with a real warranty."
R2JCK7ZJNMAF1O,"It does the job for the limited time it lasts. I've only had it for a few weeks and it's already starting to warp. This is my second one. I'm sure it will break before the season is over like my last one did. The problem is, there really isn't anything else out there for this size stove that I've found. I'd recommend buying it as cheaply as you can find because it won't stand the test of time."
RHYEHG1HOOW38,"I have the Wonderwood Model 2941 and this fits just fine. It takes two to completely replace the entire woodbox. One grate fills the woodbox halfway. Just make sure the built in side holders are free of ash and they sit nicely on them. And this is the best price I could find for these anywhere. Well made, heavy and when I removed the old ones, approximately the same weight and looks just like the original pattern of the old grates. Very pleased and can recommend this product to others. I've already noticed a difference in the heat from the stove."
R3RO2Y69YKZBKZ,"I've owned this stove for 3 years now. I bought it brand new from a local farm supply store. We used to have a wood burning stove but I thought maybe this would be a safer and easier to use alternative to a new wood burning stove.The bad:I have to clean it out once a day, even if I use expensive wood pellets sold at fuel stores and not those fromthe farm supply store that are a little cheaper (this is a hassle as I live in Kansas where our wind chill can easily make the temperature 10 degrees colder than it actually is). Cleaning means I have to wait for it to completely cool down which can take a day in itself. Often pellets are pressed against the glass and smoke is coming out from under the door.In the first year it stopped igniting pellets and simply feeding them into the burn pot. As it was still under warranty I called US Stove, their customer service is incredibly rude, yes they speak English but I'm the customer that pays their wages maybe they shouldn't be rude when I was just trying to troubleshoot an issue. They sent me an igniter, when I inquired as how to get it installed (technician, installation instructions) they claimed we were to install it ourselves and there were no install help or instructions. Apparently we installed it incorrectly and the igniter broke within a few days. They sent me another one and that one also broke within a week. I contacted them yet again and turns out my motherboard was broken so they had to send me another igniter and a motherboard.This year after running it for three days it's not igniting pellets again. And they don't have the igniter for this model on their website so now I have to deal with their customer service again.The Good:It does a great job heating my 1700 square foot house...when it actually is able to function.With how often things are breaking on this stove and how awful their customer service is I tell people to buy another other brand than US Stove. Way to go using planned obsolescence, wish I knew where to buy parts for this thing besides through US Stove. Yes, I understand things break and require maintenance but this is to the point of things breaking and being very poorly made."
R159EAXABTFXVU,exactly what I expected
R36J2VLGKGBF42,"Best thing that I did to stove,,,,,,keeps dirt down great,,,,,box was easy to put together, and it fit on stove good,,,,,love it,,,,,,"
R1ME9QH7D12JK7,great shop stove
R17KKZJ8OV0PY7,This kit is only good for a open top barrel because it's impossible to build with A closed top barrel. Need to be able to get on the inside to screw on the bolts. Plus with an open top burial comes with three rings around the barrel instead oftwo rings which is impossible to fit the exhaust stack on top to be flush with the barrel
R2DJD9S3BG1INT,great for the garage
R2AWNFL3E222NP,Had it installed for a year now saves on electric bill of constantly running the fan. Easy to install
R130AZ4ZLWZ5Q5,Good price and as described. One block had corner broke but othe 5 in excellent shape. Packaging could have been better.
R1F0C10KICUTN2,Perfect fit for wonderluxe wood/coal stove. Fast shipping.
R36ZHZZTS2OWQG,"If you wanna control your Weber like a pricey smoker or U.D.S., this couldn't be a closer 2nd if you tried. With these bricks lining my Weber kettle, I can cook @ any temperature steadily for hours. Even when the coals are nearly dark, the heat retention is fabulous. These bricks let you turn your kettle into a wood fired oven if you fancy it. Good product & would happily recommend to anyone."
R3PEFA939CYT55,Didn't work so I returned it.
R3V095VJ0COXH3,"they were exactly what I needed and ordered, priced right and arrived within a few days. I would recommend them to anyone."
R12I9C1RAMEZVB,Brick came in damaged 4 of the 12 bricks ends were broken. Needed better packaging. Product is great through much more dense then the brick I bought locally. It did cost more than home depot by 7 bucks a box. So i it a three star becauseI liked the product minus two stars for lack of protection for freight and cost.
R19G07SYA9V3RX,"Great product,great price"
R28MJMR8VB4027,"This product is a joke and not worth the money.The fan barely blows.The stovepipe doesn’t draw well with the heat tubes put in it. Has no on off switch, just a thermostat switches.I would not recommend one to anyone."
R23C8KW0G3TFNO,"This was easy to assemble and worked on my Englander 3500 add on furnace. I had to modify it, but knew that before I ordered it! Fits the standard filter size like it says! Fantastic!"
R1I219TA9GWIR9,"It was about what I had expected after I had read the other reviews. The casting is rough , received no knob for the handle. Plus the screw that holds the latch won't stay secure.And the package was ripped wide open on one end . So I assume the knob may have fallen out during shipment. And I left the large bung hole in place for added draft. The silly little Draft they make is quite useless. Didn't take long to assemble.Easy peezy.But all in all I still made it work. Now I can heat my little shop in the winter and be cozy working on projects.Delivered on time was great. Never a problem with Amazon."
R2JS2BVVSRCLJK,I ordered the double barrel and the lower at sametime the upper came today.Opened it NO INSTRUCTIONS real nice. The lower won't be here till sometime in Nov. Had I had known this I would have purchased it from the local hardware store.
RGKZ5J9Y5XK1F,"The first two boxes I got had every brick brocken, so I contacted the US Stove Company and they replaced both boxes.I did take pictures as I was opening them so they could see them.They replaced both boxes completely free to me.I have not open the box yet to see how they made it.I hope they are ok.US Stove Company was very good to me and I would recommend them to any one."
R1452D6ALCG8MG,Very good.
RJ8E8OBOP8DL,made in china had mine less then 18 monthsand called factory a few times now. the exhaust blower needs to be replaced and this thing never ran rite and produced less heat then i expected and is fairly loud when running. i gave it two stars because the auto ignition does usually work and it is fairly good looking. ihad the quadra fire for about 10 years and replaced it with this unit. i feel as though if you keep it clean you should be able to get at least 5 years out of these things with out needing parts so perhaps my expectations are too high? i have had 4 pellet stoves and one wood burner. the wood burner throws way more heat!! no comparison!
R25WBFKXODKR5,It fit and we have used it one time and it seam to work just fine
RFB1N9ZFG3FNM,"Expensive if you go to the Pellet Stove Websites ($90.00+) and be gentle with it as it can break easily...and of course you need it to run your pellet stove, I am glad I looked here on Amazon."
REU1COBBJDPOH,Quick delivery and as advertised.
RYDZW1V385VF1,"Season one no problems. Season two it sounded like a 747 was landing in my living room. US Stove refused to help. Looking in to the issue it was the room fan making all the noise. The replacement fan was $100.00 more expensive on the US Stove web site then Amazon. Do Amazon got my money. Fourth season and the replacement room fan works great. Also season two the igniter failed to light. US Stove sent me a replacement. The replacement worked a month then went out again. No help the second time from US Stove. Since igniter failure I use gelled lighter fluid from TSC. It is a bit pricy but I no longer have to deal with US Stove. Season three the exhaust fan went out. Again US Stove was $100.00 more than Amazon so Amazon got my money again. So far season four it seems to work. However if anything happens in season four, you will likely see this US Stove multi fuel on eBay for a cheap price. I like the pellet stove because of the abundance of heat and the money it saves. However the savings seen to go mostly to Amazon for replacement parts for this stove. Season five there will be pellet heat in my house. Time will tell if US Stove will provide it or their competitor."
R1TE18YP1KHDLJ,"They were exactly what I needed.I was replacing the brick in my Country Wood Stove.I had two bricks that were broken in shipping.They could do a better job of packing them tightly in the secondary packaging to prevent movement.Other than that, great product."
R3HRFG74BEL0PS,Poor packaging resulted in all 6 bricks having at least one cracked corner.3 cracked at the mid point and were unusable.
R2JP3R040H5FWJ,Fits perfectly on our fireplace insert! Love it!
R3HNRX6KQRCU3X,Works great.
R2N6SZ6DBGIGIM,A little smaller than I wanted. Does it's job though.
R1NWK6G205QJMT,1 Was chipped
R1S8BA7L9641AJ,Some came broken
R3QCG4BOSHWL7V,Thank goodness for customer reviews. I am in the market for a furnace BUT it will not be this one! Would only hope that the manufacturer reads these reviews also. For their own good. I don't mind spending a little extra money but it has to be a quality item.
R3PZPHPBZLVQF8,Great for the bottom of a wood stove.
R29XFHZM625773,Great
R2YUGDQTYRGSND,"Exactly what the chimney needed ... Solid structure, made to last"
R3SFUGM9L9UDH2,"I'm of the state of mind as ""yankee papa"" is: put a brick or something else that's fireproof under it in the middle facing the long end (or even better, two of them). That way, it won't sag nearly as much if you can find the right size of brick."
R12GZHQG0SX8BV,Arrived on time.Good product just didn't meet my needs.
RA1NL20KFWTHL,The item was a described and worked well. Arrived on time. Would definitely recommend this seller as well as this item.
R21CUG9BTAYH0Q,I was so happy to find this item.The part went in with no problem.It looks and works like new. Thanks.
R2A6RCD0UJYPPM,"The damper is very high quality cast metal.. was used in an outdoor chimney for campfires.The edges had to be adapted for a square ceramic flue line.. so I used an emery chop saw to shave a half inch off four sides (hard to do on a circle.. but adapted it to my needs.The metal is high quality, and was hard to cut even with the proper blade.The average person is not going to need to cut this damper, but I was even more impressed with the quality of the product, when I tried to cut into it."
R27RXD988C7HIB,"We absolutely love this product!It is energy efficient, as it captures the heat that would normally go up your stove pipe!It is simple to install and the product arrived on time as promised."
R334TPJ8KPLAQC,my dilivery was on time and exactly what i expexted awesome for my backyard forge and iwil recomend to others.
R3KNZELS27QUVH,"Fit My little stove perfectly ,Makes building a fire easier and keeping it lit. Sturdy for its size. Fair price"
RXXOKFNUSUFBU,This board was perfect for what we needed it for. The pricing was right and the stove is running great now that we have the right circuit board.
R3VJG6PSRS2LCC,This booster heater fit easily into the exhaust stack of our new wood stove. I'll up-date on the efficiency once it is up and running
R36SU819CXAUPI,"they are good size to fit stove with no cutting, and seem to work great in my stove, one was cracked and broke off at the end but chose to keep it. It was probably fine before delivery. Would buy these again."
R36IAP5UPPJQPX,"Damage to product when received. Needed it, so modified it with a hammer. Did not bother with a complaint. Price was very good on this item and it was delivered as promised. Satisfied with purchase, minus the minor damage."
R1OCKUBHAUHRH0,Vey heavy and nice little hen!! I would recommend this product. I think for the price it is the best around!!
R32F818LV32PJF,Filters out fine dust and house is cleaner used with a good filter not just a standard filter.very easy to install beware of sharp edges when assembling.
R8X9SFYYHBX74,After using it for a week or so in our wood stove it sags in the middle till it's touching the fire bricks. The whole thing sags like a trampoline with too much weight on it.I suggest putting a brick under it.
R26SHNE78MJT4I,"A very cold winter here and when I finally decided to crank up the wood stove I read that a grate would help combustion. When I removed the item from the box I found it was damaged as casted. The cast crack was offset by a half inch along the outside edge. Since this item is hard to find and expensive to ship/return I decided to use it anyway as is. It's almost spring and it's still intact, when it does fail I will still be able to repair it with some wire. Hope yours ships with zero defects."
R1OAIU96J6B0O6,"Replaced old blower with this unit, other than a bent casing that I easily straightened out with a pair of pliers, it fit in the existing holes in my wood stove. Good air flow and very quiet. Very pleased with this product."
R1K05RKD6E5TQY,"I wish I paid attention to how small this steamer was.I got it because it was priced lower than the others, but now I know why. It can only stay on our wood stove a few hours before the water evaporates completely."
R2IH0D5RGJ5PA3,"having used the grate for about a month, it has warped in the middle already, could be made more durable."
R6LZ9SWMWLZT8,Will not melt when you build a hot fire on it.Made in the good old USA.Do not buy the Vogelzang.
R3R3R96B0Y0S9S,"I love this it really helps to keep so much dust from being pushed into heater ducts, less dusting great!!!!!"
R2DW7OTOCY97JW,The US Stove 80473 Exhaust Blower requires a 88100 gasket and it was missing when I received the package. I have been a long time customer of Amazon and this is the first time that I am truly disappointed with my order. I searched threw your web site and was unable to buy Gasket.Can you please sell me the gasket so that I can complete my repair.ThanksManny
RICV8MGE4ZO8L,"The CB36 was easy to install and runs reasonably quietly.Using the blower definitely increases the comfort level in my shop/garage.I'd prefer that it had a little higher output, but it was well worth the cost."
R1FHJ5D6JC85SH,Direct replacement. No problem installing. tested and it works great. Would order this again if needed. I'm a happy camper.
RLPC4BPVDNBK0,"Was everything I expected it to be. Perfect for the app. Makes for a good outside wood stove, or a shop stove."
R2PH1ER5A4QMJ5,"I purchased this for our new wood stove and couldn't be happier!You do have to season it like with all cast iron to prevent rusting.It is a bit smaller than I expected, but that's ok - just have to refill it more often.I put some cinnamon sticks in the water and the room smells great!!Packaging and delivery could be better. I gave it only 4 stars because of the small size.UPDATE: 2015-2016 was the last one - it rusted out beyond control and it stained my wood stove top.It lasted 2 years at best. Channing the rating to 3, but maybe it should be 2?"
RPMFX1JMLIUQ2,Perfect size and shape for what I wanted.Arrived quickly.Very pleased. I recommend this item to anyone interested in a cast iron steamer.
R1K1R9ZV0GVTP6,"Does not throw out much heat, fan keeps going in and out, when running it's not blowing much heat. Should have bought the one that I had before it was much more efficient."
R1DEHZHC1FO0LP,I ordered 2 packs of bricks one came almost intact the other one had two of six broken bricks. ( I did not bother sending them back figured it would be a waste)
R21ZH90MX4S789,I purchased these for my wood burning stove insert.When I bought my house there were none in the stove.Unfortunately while they LOOKED like they'd fit - they were a bit too big to fit into the provided spaces.I've had to resort to laying them against the side walls instead of snuggly under the overlap that is supposed to hold them in place.It's not ideal but its working.Make sure you measure before you buy.
R1W778PCQ31753,"If you have a wood burning barrel conversion stove and have it plumbed with 6"" pipe more than 4' then you're going to need a second damper to keep it from back drafting, don't ask me how I know!"
RCHVI1Y7JPQEK,"UPS delivered this late yesterday afternoon.Filled it with water & put it on the wood stove last evening.By this morning, there were already a considerable number of rust spots on it, and also chips where the paint has flaked off.The cut-outs are rough & incomplete, with jagged edges.Some of what are obviously supposed to be cut-outs as pictured aren't even pierced though, much less cut out.I'll keep it but only because shipping it back would be too costly as it's cast iron & weighs a lot, but am very disappointed with this product."
R37J78LSTX9280,Our damper had pretty much been destroyed through excessive heat. It was so nice to get a new one. It works perfectly and was an excellent price!
R36OWOIXDYNF6J,Item was in perfect condition on arrival.It has been installed and does not appear to have any defects.Looking forward to many yearsof service from it.
RT9HAQ8BX2W93,"In order to be perfect, there the product should come with a rope gasket. And maybe a detailed instruction for the installation."
R2JSVV9HF1YZIK,Cast iron grate was a perfect fit for my stove and allowed air flow and space under the logs to easily start the fire. Grate is of quality material and should last a lifetime.Shipped ahead of schedule and price was extremely reasonable.
RW2L1T8O4MG9F,"The blower I received is now working just as good as the original did before the motor burned out. That being said it was not the simple 1 minute replacement job that it should have been. The only reason I paid over three times the amount of money for this brand name US Stove Company replacement part was because I was worried the no-name generic store brand may not fit correctly. So when I received my replacement part and went to install it I was annoyed to find that this new blower didn't fit at all. I double checked the model numbers on both my original and the new one they sent and sure enough they were the same. The majority of the components in both of the blowers were even identical. In fact, the only difference between the two was the outside casing on the new one held the internal components in a way that prevented it from fitting into the stove correctly. Fortunately for me, aside from the motor, everything on my old blower was in working condition. I was able to disassemble the two blowers and replace just the motor but if I didn't have the old blower and casing I would have been stuck returning the new item and making calls to the company trying to figure out how I made a mistake with the replacement model number. I have been shopping online for over a decade and this is the first dissatisfied review I have ever had to write. I don't know if I just got one off a bad batch or if the dimensions of the blowers changed since I bought my stove. Either way, if you are buying this as a replacement, be sure hold on to your original casing."
R2AQBOVNBZ3VHZ,after 2 months of use had a sag in the middle between the feet. after 3 months it snapped in half .
R34ZERKY5O2V19,works ok the clamp that holds the wires inside the box is not insulated after time it wears into the wiring which shorts out the wires if you buy one change the clamp or modify it
R36TA68FI2ABWZ,"I recently bought this model from US Stove and this was my experience: The control panel was dead on arrival. They sent another panel, but you're responsible for installing it yourself. The unit worked for two weeks and then started smoking out of every crevice (not the back - literally out of every crevice). Fortunately I was home, but this should not happen. I had to pour water in the fire box to put out the smolder - the stove didn't really function properly. The company offered $30/hour - that's right - THIRTY - for me to hire someone to look at it. As you can imagine, I can't get anyone to even call me back at $30/hour. The company won't take it back and they won't help in any other way. I have a $2,000 piece of useless metal in my house.

R2GO10UXQAHUAS,"The main thing this grate had going for it was that it fit in the bottom of my wood stove.I used it almost every evening for a couple of weeks.It was a replacement for a grate that had lasted about five years before finally warping badly from heat.Each day I remove the grate with my bare hands--it's not hot at this point--and plop the grate down on the lawn beyond the back porch to shake some of the ashes off of it.Then, after cleaning the ashes out of the stove, I bring the grate back in and return it to its place in the stove.Again, I've done this almost every winter day for about five years--five with the old grate and two weeks with the new grate.This afternoon, I did the same thing I always do, but the grate broke in half when it landed on the lawn.That's grass on sandy soil that I dropped it on from about two feet off the ground.A cast iron grate shouldn't break from being plopped down onto a lawn.I'm thinking that the cast iron was of a poor quality.I'm going to find another grate."
R3P6JNFD0L2ZLR,"Worked just fine for my 1600 Clayton/us stove. I think the price is a bit high for a chunk of steel but frankly I didn't shop around, I didn't even go to my local wood stove place. I just saw it online and ordered it. Prolly overpaid, It showed up and I put it in. Mine had a chunk missing out of the top, it probably would have lasted for quite awhile.. Also I could have took the one at the front of the stove and switched it with the one in the back.. Then it would definitely lasted longer."

R1QXGO58BC04EH,Fit perfectly in the fireplace - I did however get them and 3 of them were broke but I managed to makethem work.Might want to figure out a better way to package this item so less breakage occurs.
R2BNZ5YLGIPXFK,Very pleased with this fan.We have had others that were much louder.This fan is quiet and pushes a lot of air. Easy to install and Quiet !!
R3ALZF1JMO9ZT4,"Super service as always, I love the item as is exactly as order and advertised. Works as good as one can get."
R1F2CZ6K4Y6J4R,"it worked perfect for 3 times, then failed. On the 3rd time, it acted like it wanted to work, but wouldn't ignite pellets, instead it created a huge smoldering pile of pellets that filled our place with terrible smelling smoke that took 3 hours to disperse. I can't explain how disappointed I am that I spent $50+ on this igniter. Also, I was not happy either that this igniter is about 1/2 inch longer then the original one, so I stuck out the back where pellet dust can collect. It was red hot and made me REALLY nervous it would ignite the pellet dust.BAD PRODUCT and WAY over priced!!!We are going to continue to light it manually from now on."
R1F4SDPHAWRZW9,The liner was as described it fit into the stove . The Shipping estimate was exact. I installed the liner in minutes and the stove works properly.
R1QNVHDID1HMKN,All of our bricks were broken into RUBBLE I even sent a note...no reply I will never order something like this again since there is no way to know if you will get what you paid for or just a bunch of junk...probably my most disapointing Amazon purchase ever!!!
R3AD8XJPH86MWI,"For people with a modern stove that recirculates gas and can be sealed up nearly airtight, a flue damper such as this is unnecessary and potentially dangerous.The only potential benefit might be that it could help seal off the chimney when not in use to help cold air from blowing down the chimney into the house.For those of us that use and outdated stove that is nearly impossible to regulate airflow using the intake dampers alone, a flue damper such as this can be useful.Since the stove I have is basically just a big steel box from the '70s, I have had a hard time controlling burn effectively and so decided to give this a try.At only a few dollars, if it didn't help I could live with the hit.Sure enough it did help in my situation.I don't understand some of the complaints about quality; for $5 as long as it's not cracked or warped you really can't complain.I can't see it ever getting damaged while it's installed, though I could see the potential when removing it for cleaning.Keep in mind that you absolutely need to have the damper fully open whenever opening your stove door, otherwise smoke will flow out of the door and into your house, no matter the condition of the fire."
R1GP795V43P8JT,"My family has used this stove for the past three seasons here in New Hampshire and love it. We picked it up at TS for $1000 and heat our entire 2000s/f home with it. Of the 9 settings 1 is perfect at 30* while 3 works well at -10* making level 4 uncharted territory in our house. Typically we burn a little more than a bag a day at the first setting and a little less than two bags at the 3rd setting but since the hopper can literally fit three bags of pellets we also don't worry about constant fillings. I do have to agree with other posts that the instructions could use some help. Also I have found over the years that whatever level/heat range (1-3) we set the stove to, we need to set the draft fan one level higher so when we run at 1 the draft fan is manually set to 2. This seems to keep the burn pot from getting gummed up. Another thing that we do is to keep the room fan on 9 to get the most heat off the stove and out into the room. While noisy with the room fan on high, the stove is in the dining room which keeps the noise tolerable in the adjoining living room or kitchen. Whiling cleaning it is a pain it usually only takes 10 minutes. One thing I find that helps is to turn the stove on when cleaning it with the hopper lid open which seems to draw any dust through the unit instead of out into the room. When starting it I also make sure to start it at the first setting (heat range 1) so that the burn pot doesn't overflow with pellets before it has a chance to light. Typically it lights w/o intervention. With the last 3 seasons averaging just less then 4 tons of pellets each year we are not only savings money but enjoy the constant heat that this stove provides. The only thing that we have had to replace to date is an auger motor that failed half way through the second season. The $125 motor was shipped quickly and replacing thepart was done easily since it was only held on by a single cotter pin. For the price, a great stove!!"
R3EA6EY8HIV1J0,I don't like the openings on the top -- cause it looks like stuff can fall in there .. but It works good .. I wish it came with a thermostat as I had to buy that extra .. but with the really cold winter we are having this winter(2014) I am glad I bought it ..
R1OZEPS52LHRP4,"I've had mine for two years and bought it used, but it looked brand new. The vibration caused one of the brackets to break. the squirell cage hits all the time now making an ungodly sound and causing the motor to heat up and quit. There's no way to just replace the bracket and they are very expensive. These brackets should be much more robust to withstand the constant vibration."
R30Z7CGYU8XR2I,"This item lasted us less than two months in our wood stove before the middle section sagged down to the bottom.I turned it upside down for a couple weeks to straighten it out.Then I turned it right side up again and placed a section of angle iron in the middle to hold it up.Nevertheless, the middle position oxydized away in less than two months.The iron the Chinese used for this is of very low quality.However, I only paid $20 for it, this time, at Tractor supply, and at that is what it's worth.Know what you are buying.( Oh, I did find a similar grate, high quality long lasting iron that will last many years.It was $259. )"
R195G6P6NKRY3R,"I like how it looks on the stove.. The inside got rusted in less that a day after I putting water in it.. It's called a Potpourri Steamer.. so you need water..it could use a better paint,, maybe something that bakes on to seal the casting.."
RVVWCBI94RGV7,"RECEIVED MY KIT AND INSTRUCTIONS, VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AFTER THE CUTTING OF MY 55 GALLON DRUM.WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS AND OTHERS."
RIEYHQPH01L50,Love it. Easy to install. My stove is at the end of a large room and this fan moves the heat just like I needed it to. Don't know how I did without it.
RRVJ0A9W6M4Y2,"We have wood burning stoves, which dry out the rooms.This is suppose to be a potpourri, but we use it for a steamer to humidify the room.It works great I only wish it were a bit larger.I have also put fragrance oils in the water and it works to fragrance the room.I cannot use potpourri because if it gets too hot it burns and leaves a bad odor.But as a steamer it works great.I was disappointed that the inside of the iron hen was not finished. It rusted right away and as a result discolors the water.Hopefully, the steam will not leave a residue.I am on guard for that just in case.I am going to attempt to cure it, but I am not sure how that will work.Otherwise, we like it."
R8WLGCEGSZKOA,It worked out as well as the original. Easy to order but delivery was one day late. We will be returning to your site for future needs.
R3GNNID4UECSY6,"brought a us stove 5500m pellet stove,had stove less than one year. igniter went out, they replace under warranty. but if I need and other, they wanted 59.00 plus shipping. new one is working find this winder, no problems. they told me by phone when I talk to them that theymay last only a year and may need replacing again. other than that, I like the stove. tractor supply sold it to me and they sale the pellets in ft. worth for just over 5 bucks for a 40 lb.bag, not too bad."
R3HIU11VCX8E68,"The first thing i noticed was the wires were too close to the pipe,No heat shield for wiring? I couldn't see how this could work; but for some reason I went ahead and installed it anyway.It only lasted a few days; It quit working? I found out that the GFCI was off; when I turned it back on the sparks flew out the back of the unit and it made a loud snapping sound. I found out that the wires were melted together; and the thermo switch had burned out.I sent the company an email; asking if there was a warranty but they never got back to me. I really didn't care because It was too much trouble to remove it; and I would have to go buy new stove pipe so decided to fix it myself. I removed the thermo switch andwired up the fan so it would work when I plugged it in. I moved the wires as far away from the pipe as possible. Now when I want the fan to work I have to plug it in. It's working okay now.The fan is a little noisey but it does kick out a lot of heat. When it was working the fan would kick in and out every few seconds; it was annoying. If you buy one I would recommend rewiring it before you install it."
RAPZ35ZSLGRPX,"I was unhappy because it said it was a kit, and there was no barrel in the kit! No explanations of the product"
R2E2ZWPR2MGTO6,very easy add on to install. I did it by myself but it would be easier with help. took about an hour
R1W8W1YN9NKVKD,Two of the six fire bricks arrived and were broken.Receiving 66% of what I ordered is pretty poor performance.
R2YZLHT8XI0IU4,"I purchased this to use as a stovetop humidifier.I cook with cast iron and so had reasonable expectations for how water works with this material--yes, it does rust if it's not seasoned... and even with seasoning, continual exposure to water would eventually cause it to rust.That's just the nature of cast iron.It's small size causes it to not take up a huge amount of space on my stove top but the design is such that the water doesn't evaporate so quickly that I can't keep up with it.One day, I moved it to the top of my radiator to make room for something else and was delighted with how it looked... the width is just right and the aesthetics of the steamer fit right into my decor...Problem is that the radiators don't generate enough heat to keep the water steaming, but they do transfer the heat into the steamer... the hen is always the same temperature as my radiator.On a whim, I emptied the water and tossed in some fragranced essential oil--just enough to coat the bottom.Every time the heat goes on, the room becomes pleasantly scented--not overwhelming... just right!I don't worry about kids or dogs knocking them over because they're stable and virtually indestructible.These little hens are adorable (I've got two...), are the best room fragrance diffusers that I've ever used and are a great value for a dual-purpose household item."
R14JAPMVRQA3J7,"They ALL arrived broken.Actually, they are ok for the project I have working but, if I were using them normally it would be VERY expensive to play the mail game!I was not thrilled with that outcome but, I kept them because of my special situation.Buy them at home if you can find them there."
RRJ5Q0FOTL3TM,I purchased this as a gift and the recipients were thrilled!The steamer is very cute and the perfect size for a small woodstove.
R2FIR62NCRPVYF,they worked great .they fit with out having to make any changes. they where delivered with no problems. very happy would recommend
R3V0ESK9GUB1RA,Bit smaller than I anticipated but fits very nicely on wood stove nicely.Must be cured before using or you will have rust..
R3JVRFXE247EGL,This works perfect for small fireplaces & wood stoves.Very sturdyAllows air underneath so starting fires and keep them lit is much easier now.
R1GVBE7A9P7S7V,I'm so thankful that I don't have start my stove with a torch anymore. Now it's just a push of the button.
R2KCN8XYMHPR92,"Fits great, works perfect! I would buy this product again if I need to replace another gasket in my wood burning fireplace heater."
R3BUEE3WFRBNZB,"My husband bought this and installed on our wood stove to circulate the heat in his man cave. It does a great job circulating the heat throughout the room and now people are not huddling around the stove to get warm.UPDATE: It started out doing a great job and now the temp sensor fell off so he bypassed the thermostat. Now it will run for a few minuets and quits. He thinks he will use it for target practice.UPDATE of UPDATE: Wires melted so it's now useless, very poor design....words of caution....do NOT buy, not worth the money or frustration!"
R1525KU0MF5FD6,This was an easy fix from tear down to back up and running was less than 30 minutes.It was a great fit
R13E9VPEO616NO,I use this as grill above my gas powered smoker.I had to cut it with a hack saw to fit(hint: make a smaller one).Works great!!!!
R3BX19MRK6O2N9,I like this blower !! however I don't like the openings on the top of the blower anything can drop in there and ruin the blower.. just like that! I did buy the add on so it goes on and off with the temperature -- it runs quiet doesn't raddle the stove .. I need to put something above the fan to keep any thing from dropping in the fan
R2CJNFHUH0X5D0,We ordered 2 sets and both had broken bricks. 4 in all we broke. Not worth the hassle of returning.
R1UKP1YPFTPXKT,"the 1st stove kit my brother and I built was back in the late 1970's out of (at 1st )a single 30 gal barrel then after the 1st winter we added a 2nd barrel .at was made to heat a oversized 2 cars garage at our family's house and worked great the garage would stay at 70 to 80 degrees F. .for the last 5 years now I have been using a twin 50 Gal barrel set up in the shop area of my fabrication business .i'm not sure if the sqr footage of the shop area but it holds 10 to 12 race cars .the oil heat was killing me to heat this place !we get so much material shipped to us on wood pallets / skids that we had stacks and stacks of them out in back of the shop just rotting away with still more coming in .though back to when I lived at home and bough this kit .so for 5 winters now going on to the 6th we have been burning wood for heat .this shop area stays at a nice 75 degrees all day every day of the week even on days like today were the temp is -3 out side the shop is 72 degrees .when we leave at night we fill the stove with wood to keep the heat going when we are not here and in the morning when I come in the shop temp is about 60 all the time in the mornings .when I 1st got this kit years ago the leg had a crack in it that is what the 4 stars are for . I welded it and it's been fine !the quality of the kit is very cheap with some of the worst casting you will ever come across .but it is worth the money you pay for them !the name US stove would lead you to think it's a US co. THAT builds the kit not so it's made in china .so now you know why the quality is so low .because we burn skids we do have to change the stove pipeing every year and the barrels every 3 years the cost of the piping we get is about 125 dollars every year for the 6"" piping .barrels are another thing we get for free from the business as we buy our oils in them . the down side to our barrels is the tops do not come off so it makes replacing them a PITA because there is not much axes to get the nuts and bolts that hold the things like the legs on .on average day we burn 4 to 5 skids and on very cold days like today were is -3 outside we go thru 5 to 7 skids .it takes about 30 to 40 minutes to cut up about 10 to 12 skids that fill our wood bin .to get the shop up to temp 75 degrees from when we 1st get here and the temp is at 60 or so is about an hour .if your thinking of just a single barrel for get it ! go with the twin barrel set up the heat you lose out the stove pipe on a single barrel is not worth it even if the wood is free like it is for me .fill the very bottom of the barrel with about 4"" of sand and then you have to buy or make (like we did ) a grate for the wood to sit on .skids are made of soft and hard woods or all soft or all hard that depends on the weight they are made to carry .the soft pine type woods burn fast and put out a lot of heat and yes they do leave creosote in the pipes but it's not half as bad as what people will tell you . about 2 times a year we use a stove pipe brush and clean out the crap in the stove pipes . but if you look at the hours of use (every day in winter months ) 24 hours a day it's running you know why we clean it so much .the fire box gets cleaned out every week keeping things clean is important 1st is so the creosote will not catch on fire and the other the stove burns the wood much better of every thing is clean ."
RTXD3BK8GO9C5,Great replacements.
R3E2R658I81XQK,"it fits my small wood stove and last one lasted about 5 years..despite weight, package arrived in good shape."
R24RB87M4JGRT6,This Cast Iron Grate actually works for at least a couple of US Stove Models. It was a perfect fit for the one I purchased earlier this year. Only concern I have with it is after just a few months of use the Grate has bent a bit in the middle. The Cast Iron itself is probably not of the best quality.
R3AC3XCZD2TFB,"I like it as it is very cute,but it is cheap thin cast iron and I have to refill it several times a day as it is small.I should have spent more and got a better one.This is all rusted inside and yucky now after a month of use.Still cute on the outside.Would not purchase another,I would get a better one next time as I am sure this won't last a long time."
RHC4ZCREHPAKY,"I've been looking for a small grate like this for my woodstove, to be able to lift the logs off the bottom of the stove for better burning.I regret not listening to more of the reviews; I have used this for a week, and already the middle of it has weakened, buckled, and I assume before long will break as others report it.Just being advertised as made of cast iron does do much if it is weakly constructed. I'm no engineer, but I would bet a middle set of feet wood work and/or cross bars to better support it.I'm planning to sketch my own design and find a local blacksmith who can build me something that will work more than a week or a month. If you want something decorative to use in a stove that you never burn wood in, this might be the item for you."
R148OAYVT2VZM7,"The unit failed on its second use.The cost to remove, return and reinstall is more than the unit is worth. Also it does not reclaim much heat,the heat powered fan on the stove does a better job. I should have bought based on quality not price."
R122KAWUU57M5J,It was exactly the right part and it was a better value than ordering direct from the manufacturer! Which is great!
R2F0JUQSKM24TS,Many of the firebricks were broken. But when I emailed about the problem things were taken care of promptly. Thank you.
R265TB06T0BVPX,for the top barrel it's not rocket science I just need the major adaptor parts. some have complained about the bolts but to me that'sno big deal.
RTQ8FJQDCLFYQ,"I have one of these on both my 6” & 8” stoves but it’s not there to control the draft. These were designed for stoves that really didn’t have much draft control to help control the burn. However, most modern stoves have vents somewhere near the burn chamber to help combustion and using one of these often just causes a smoke issue. I use both of mine to close off the pipe after the fire has died to help keep most of the cold air from flowing into the firebox and turning my stoves into huge ice boxes. The rooms seem to stay a bit warmer without adding all that cold air directly to the firebox. Here in the sub-zero weather keeping as much cold out as possible helps. These do have some holes so you can’t totally block off the downdraft… but it helps greatly. It takes a little finagling to get it in but all you have to do other than that is drill 2-holes near the ends on a pipe to make it easier. After it’s installed I’d recommend that you put 3-screws in every pipe joint equally spaced apart. At under 5 bucks this is a good deal compared to the cost at the home improvement stores."

R37ATSJ3RMGI3I,"This worked perfect, it helps keep our stove burning hotter because less heat goes out the stack, and warms up the shop real well"
R3UOUFM6DR49BJ,"Purchased a King 5502M pellet stove from my local tractor supply company,That was the easy part.From the get go this has been a disaster.I have had nothing but issues with this stove since the get go.First the pipe that is used tovent the stove outside was flush against the lower portion of the stove so we could not get any pipe on it to vent it outside,I took photos and sent it to US stove co. like they requested.Never heard anything from them again.I don't even know if they received the photos, they don't acknowledge a thing.That problem fixed, the stove ran great for about a week, then we started getting error 2 and the stove shut down.after about a week of batteling that problem I was on the phone with US Stove co. trying to figure out what was going on because no pellets were dropping into the burn pot, and the auger motor fell from its loction to the bottom of the stove,The hairpin holding the auger motor to the auger sheered off, and damaged the auger as well.Had to bed for overnight delivery service for replacement parts.We replaced the auger motor, auger and hairpin.the stove ran great for 2 days.Now it is a new anchor in my family roomPellets won't drop, auger isn't working. And what do I get from US Stove.We will have a technical consultant contact you.I called back today and asked for the phone # of someone who can help me out and US Stove customer service is the worst.They say they don't have any service tech's but they are going to contact their service tech.Does that make any sense?So very dissapointed with this stove and US Stove Company.Their customer service and technicians are the worst.It is almost like they sold you the stove and now it is your problem.We went with this stove because the reviews were pretty good, and the price was right.That was a big mistake.I wish we went with a different stove, at least I would be warmer than I am now.I do not recommend this stove to anyone, and if it is from New England Stove Good Luck.They are the worst."
R3DDK6ZJDT6Z6C,Great price. Will look here next time the old ones warp or break. Maybe I'll be able to buya different furnace with the money I save buying grates and not have the problem with these that occurs.
R1O8TUVYHVSCOR,"not a lot to say, it goes right in and works as it should. The only reason it's not a 5 is the welds could be a bit smoother and it seems a bit expensive."
R27R83BJTJDWN6,"Ignore the negative commenter (I've noticed that there are always a bunch who give US Stove bad reviews, only to turn right around and give Vogelzang positive reviews, often for the same material - It's a name-brand thing in most cases, nothing more). This kit is an adder kit for the lower '1st barrel' kit, so careful, you aren't getting the lower kit with this, you have to buy it seperately.That said, THIS IS A GREAT KIT ADDER! You will more-than-DOUBLE your BTU output by adding this kit to a single-barrel burner. It works by staggering the flue pipe, so that the hottest gasses coming out of your lower barrel get sent into the 2nd barrel, which makes it a giant heat radiator. I actually had a top barrel with mine that had a removable banded-clamp top that could come off, and spot-welded a half-round baffle at mid-barrel to further help with heat capture - and it was awesome. Keep in mind, the top barrel will last for years, but your bottom barrel will need more-frequent replacements, even if you use a fire grate in the bottom of the lower barrel, to keep burning fuel off the barrel wall. Yes, the nuts-and-bolts hardware was junk that I received with mine, but the cast iron was good, the connector pipe is what you need and it is good too, and the nuts and bolts are easily replaced at the nearest hardware store - where you need to buy some stove sealant, anyhow, to do this kit right.Ignore those who post about 'it was junk or too difficult', because clearly, they have no intent to actually take time to assemble anything, and then can't understand if it requires any 'finesse' to assemble it afterwards. This kit will pay for itself in a week of heat expense savings. Great for a cabin, a workshop, etc.; just remember to get the lower kit too, if you don't already have one you are using."
R2017T6HPSHM1,Purchased this motor as a replacement for my seven year old pellet stove.Works great! motor is much quieter than the original motor.
R2BDPIEB3CU4SW,"Darn I had to buy TWO....I purchased them 2 seasons ago at the end of the season there were two left for half off, so i bought one for myself and one for a rental.Good deal, one would think.I felt pretty smart.Installed them and mine started up immediately with issues.Ignitor failed, mother board failed.I replaced them, and winged thru the first season trying to forget how many hours of trying to get it started it would take from my life on season 2.The other unit ran fine at the rental (thankfully)First i held out as long as I could to start it up.Well about mid November I could hold out no longer.Started it and low and behold it worked.For a few weeks in November when it wasn't that cold it worked fine.I got all over confident, and when the temps dropped to extremely low the stove said ""GOTCHA"" and it started with the same start up issues all over again.I'm going to sell them both soon as this season is over.I had a Kozi XL simple NO COMPUTER CRAP stove where only the ignitor rod blew out a few times over the years.A simple fix, and though the price of the ignitor was too expensive at $145 each time, it may just be easier to know the machine starts up when needed.So as i m writing this, I 'm also fighting with the stove.Everyone who remarked the manual is insufficient is correct.What manual?I started it about 4 days ago and left it running till this afternoon, as the ash looked like it was in need of removal.I disagree with all the manouvres of cleaning.I use simple food grade plastic gloves and dump it out.I'm not using any vacuum, its not needed, nor should it be that sensitive.The issue is with the flawed mother board.You can start the machine manually by putting some pellets in the burner pot, using the fire gel and lighting it up.HOWEVER, i've barely succeeded in that method 2x.The machine's sensors are just not 'picking up' the signals.I'll unplug it and then you see the board ""reset"" itself.I've done that at least 6 times in an hour.Its just not worth all the hassles.Jan 4th 14.update on operations:make sure burner pot IS clean of charcoal, i wipe ash away from it daily too, then hit start, then wait for a few pellets dumped in, then hit AUGER DELAY, then i leave it alone.In my machine the flame gets HUGE which when the temp reaches a certain level the room fan blower finally kicks in.Sofar so good.jan 4, 14UPDATE: Now the temperatures are NOT COLD again, the machine is running fine...you have no idea whether you're coming or going with this thing."
R65NCNRPF66PW,It serves its purpose. It allows a nice airflow underneath the fire. It fits perfectly in my Efel Kamina wood burning stove.
R2ID8L0AL5MYU2,"It is smaller than what I thought.Have to fill it 3 times a day, but works very well.Well built."
R1IWULW6VWA1I5,"When the grate broke in our wood burning stove, we called the store where we purchased they told us it would take weeks to get a replacement.So typed the details into Amazon and there it was!With Prime, we had a new grate in two days.It was packaged well. The grate is well made and fit perfectly.I would definitely deal with this company again."
R2XMU0OJRQDP0H,"It runs quieter and better than the original blower. As for the price point, I don't believe you will find a better deal."
RX6BMZ90E2VES,"After just a week in my barrel stove, the grate developed a very noticeable sag in the center between the front and back feet. I can only assume this occurred because of the heat generated from the fire, but geez it's a fire log grate. My friend had the smaller model in his barrel stove, a G27 I believe, and his new grate did the same thing."
RBPG0B8FR5ZI1,"Great motor. Easy install. Would get 5 stars if it came with gaskets, which it does not. Cheaper than ordering from us stove. Just don't forget to order new gaskets..."
R326LHI7HETA7V,I bought two of these B000M2VTVK One of them was cast correctly and should work just fine when I need it. The second one was slightly miscast and I will have to return it. 50% success rate is not really what I would call worth recommending.
R3TVOX2OEUQA6,The chicken steamer fits perfectly on our wood burning stove. It lets out a nice amount of steam. It's made of heavy cast iron and is just what we wanted to sit on top of our stove.
R1TUNITYKR5XDK,I Bought this at Tractor supply 2 years back to heat about 2000 sfand it worked good for a month or so and then started overflowing pellets. I called the company and they were helpful in changing the feed rate settings. towards the end of the season it stopped igniting. The start of this season it started igniting again and actually seemed like it was going to be fine but it shut down after it ran out of pellets and smoked out the whole house. Tried it 2 weeks ago and it worked almost perfect minus the igniter. Now will not operate properly and I believe it is in the controls. Just bought a new Harman p43 to replace and will sell the US Stove for parts or whatever I can re coup out of it. I also own a Napoleon nps40 and it is ten times the stove this US Stove is.
RG5QIU1VBL5AV,puts the heat back in the house not up the stove pipe.Easy to install..activates almost as soon as the fire gets going..excellent investment.
R3CGEY633CU1V3,"This is the replacement for US Stove 6041 (pellet stove). It was about $50 cheaper on Amazon then from the US Stove Web site. It installed in ten minutes. It is nearly silent, much better then the original distribution fan.I used the discount to upgrade the shipping to next day. Unbelievable to me the next day it was sitting on my front porch by 4:00pm."
RWJKA3BFJ4KDB,OK for agitator but it turns the wrong way for the feed auger drve.Motor must turn clockwise as vewed from output shaft when driving the feed auger.
R3AHBCCJSU6Y34,"This stove kit works great. We added to our large oil barrel and we are now enjoying a warm fire in our shop. I would recommend this product for a basement, garage or shop. Works great!"
R10ZW0879Q9G4L,the size was not as I expected.needs to be a better description and size listing with this item on the web site.
R3MGJJ6VR5E6Y4,"I've had this model pellet stove from US stove for over 4 years (just starting my 5th season). In that time I've been very frustrated with it. It turns out though that the problem has been with the stove itself.When I first bought the stove I installed it using a 3"" exhaust vent. The setup had a clean out tee at the back of the stove, then went up 60"" to an elbow and exited the building through another 24"" of tube. With that setup from the first time I fired the stove I had nothing but problems with the pellets burning. The glass would turn black after a day and the burn pot would fill up with pellets and form a hard crust inside.I called US stove several times and they were pretty helpful. They instructed me on how to adjust the feed rate and the combustion fan. With these settings I was able to get the stove to at least work but I still had major problems with soot and burn pot overflow. I could run it for about 3 days and then I'd have to shut the whole thing down, do an extensive cleaning and start it back up again.This is installed in a large garage that also has a ceiling mounted propane furnace. A couple of years ago I decided I would just heat the garage with propane but quickly found that to be too expensive. It was about 2 1/2 times more per month than the pellet stove.Last spring I was at the Home Depot and they had a 4"" pellet vent kit on clearance for $50. I decided It was too good to pass up and thought that may help with my issue. It turns out that it was the best $50 I had spent on this pellet stove! After installing this 4"" exhaust my stove finally works properly. In addition I returned the feed rates and combustion blower settings back to where they were from the factory and everything is working normally. The vent setup is essentially the same as before but now consists of the 4"" vent instead of 3"". It seems the 3"" was too restrictive and was causing my problems. Now that I have the new vent I am pleased with the unit. Before that, I was getting ready to give up.The issue with the vent really isn't the fault of US stove, but I am still deducting a point for several reasons. First is because they really never suggested that the 3"" could be a problem. They did ask about my venting, but their main concern was that it wasn't tall enough to create a draft. Also, the manual doesn't really make a recommendation for a 4"" vent unless you go over a certain length.I do believe some of this could be eliminated with a design change. The combustion blower supply isn't a variable speed adjustment. It is an off/on cycle.They turn the motor on for x time, and then let it coast for x time. The problem with too small a vent is that during the coast time the flame becomes very lazy and sooty. If they used a variable speed combustion fan then there would be no off time for the flame to get lazy. You would be able to simply adjust the speed of the fan until your flame was optimal. A variable speed fan and motor arrangement is not very expensive and would likely fix a lot of the issues people have with these.Since new I've also gone through one igniter and also a pin for the feed motor drive. Other than that though, everything else has been fine. I'm looking forward to this finally working properly this season."
R1MEJOMGCQA8L1,"I bought this stove for $999 from Tractor supply when they had it onsale and were beating everyone else. I have a 2700 sq ft house, and this is the only thing we've used to heat it for the last 3 years. We typically only need to run it on settings 1-3 unless it gets below zero. Sometimes it will got up to setting 5 to help bring the temperature up faster in the morning, but only for an hour at most.Some challenges we faced were build up and burn rate. This being fully ""automatic"" there is no manual feed adjust knob like on our older stove, only adjustments for room fan and draft fan speeds. Build up tends to occur more on the lower settings, but when setting 1 pushes our living room to 75 or higher until it gets below mid 20's outside we can't run a higher setting. To help with that I plugged two holes in the burn pot over the front legs with some RTV, and bought a new door gasket to help force more air up through the burn pot. I also drilled out some of the holes in the burn pot to open them up more and increase air flow. It's also beneficial to buy the same brand of pellets consistently. We used to switch to whoever was cheapest at the time, and that had mixed results.One other thing you must do is clean it out! And I mean pop out the 2 removable metal tabs in the back and clean out all the ash in the exhaust channel. The back section easily because clogged with ash and reduces the air flow further adding to the ash build up from a slower burn. I find it easiest to turn the stove on with the lid open (so it doesn't feed pellets), and use an air compressor blow gun to force it all out the exhaust once the bulk of it has been vacuumed up. There is no removable ash pan so a vacuum is a must. A shop vac will work, but it's a tight fight. We had to purchase an ash vacuum to clean it.All in all with this stove and being able to buy pellets from any of a dozen different places on the way home from work we've never run out of fuel or heat like we did with oil (and were at the mercy of whenever Suburban Propane could should up). I can buy 10bags at a time to heat for 7-10 days at $40-$50 vs $400-$600 for a minimum oil delivery, and the house is warmer than it was with oil and baseboard radiators. This makes it much more budget friendly with my wife out of work, and we don't have to wait for a delivery.Added an outside air intake from Amazon this year (B003UKXBXK so the stove won't negatively pressurize the house and pull cold air in through leaks, and so far it seems like we can run the stove at a lower level than last year. It's not required for larger houses, but ours is so old and drafty this helps keep those drafts down. It's in the teens here now, and we already are not feeling the cold spots like years past. To help matters we also did a through-wall fan (B000JGSMUK to circulate air from this stove around the entire first floor of our house."
RI9NSFHVTIMJ1,This Part was an exact fit for my burnt out brick retainers. Replaced the fire brick at the same time.
R16262HB5CUZQG,"worked less than one month , no good reviews . NO OPTIONS OUT THERE TO CHOOSE FROM WHAT DO YOU DO"
R3944X42STGHPU,great grate was what I needed how many words can you say about a stove grate it works fine hope it lasts a long long time
R3V5Y4QR3HSOB9,"I bought a ""US Stove"". It has broken twice in a year. I can't even get the part that burns out anymore. I recently got talked into buying the wrong part. And they overcharged on shipping!"
R3FI0J1CKFP98A,"Started to rust the first time I used it. Hardly what I expected from something supposedly intended to heat water in. Still usable, I suppose, but VERY disappointing."
R3HBAQT22TA8LK,"This is a SMALL steamer.It fits nicely on my smaller wood stove.I like the design, and it is made from heavy cast iron construction.It's a little rough in the finish, but overall is a great little steamer.Would definitely recommend it for simmering potpourri on the stove."
R1XW9PY5HLIK4J,It is not 27.2 by 14.5 as described. So do not buy it you need a bigger one.I am sending mine back
R1VNZ5AEXX6HYW,"I gave this 4 stars because I think it is a little overpriced! However, it fits nicely into the firebox of my little log heater stove and the fire now burns much better and seems easier to start too. The logs seem to burn cleaner and leave less ash on the bottom of the stove. I wish I had bought this sooner!"
R1F2M5O2PA38PG,"This has allowed us to start our pellet stove without using matches or torches. It is easier and safer. This has a different part number than the original ignitor however, it is the substitute number and it fit and worked perfectly."
R2WMQHTSHVUEXO,"Perfect fit in my wood burning stove.We have had trouble for sometime with starting a fire with the wood sitting on the stove floor.The grate will elevate the wood, so it can get the air flow under that is needed.Waiting for the cold to try it out, but know that it will work great."
R1PIOGQYYVG5WJ,We needed a new motor for the wood stove and Amazon had the best price and could offer the original manufacturer name/model.The new motor didn't have the exact connection size we needed but it was the correct motor size so we just made an adapter plate and it worked great.
R33FUISA149RQ0,Lots of times when I bake I like to inttroduce steam into the equation.Breads rise better in a convection oven when steamed.Also souffles climb faster in the steam environment.
R2HLVFBR5DW61G,"I was all excited to get this thing because it makes so much sense. And the idea is great.Don't get me wrong . But the product itself is a joke.The one I bought. Exactly the same as this one gave out. It suddenly shorted out and sparks flew from the thermostat switch. It must have not withstood the heat or something. It is not a good thing for the long run. It makes noise, the thermostat gave out on mine, it rattles and mine ran for all of 2 months before the disastrous short out. I would not pay $10.00 for this thing if I had to buy it over again."
R38S23SYI50QOR,"We looked a long time to find a grate that would fit in our woodstove and give some air circulation for the fire,Will update after the winter to see how it holds up to constant fires."
R2EJ0LFRLP6MF0,"I ordered the bricks because I am making a micro-forge and the bricks were not available locally. The first order came in and the bricks were packed tightly into a small box which was then put into a much larger with NO cushioning at all. Only 1 out of the 6 bricks were intact, and the rest were either completely broken or so severely damaged I ended up with about a full cup of firebrick crumble. I contacted the company Ozbo which email me back the next day and said they would re-send the order. It came in very similarly packed as the previous one but much to my surprise all 6 were fine. Firebrick tends to be more fragile than regular bricks and I was surprised and pleased the 2nd order was in tact. If I had any complaint it would be that the product should have at least a bit more padding, but as I said, the response was about as fast as it could be and I got none of the usual argument or resistance from Ozbo and a replacement was fairly quick to arrive."
R2VCY6EQTJGY7G,"This grate was fine, however the advertisment doesn't bother to tell you that you need 2 of these.Other than that it was fine."
R1I5RWUD09QSGH,I love my steamer.It looks so cute on my wood stove!It is heavy cast iron and is well made.
R2CXGKVLEWJ6B9,"This part was inexpensive and within no time our Pellet wood burning heater was back up and running, my research has shown this product needs replaced of and on so would buy again"
R1C9J8T7ORYP7R,"loved it, just what I was looking for, thanks.would recommend to anyoneThis way I can decrease to a six in. or increase back up to a eight inch.."
R3928RFLTH5ZWG,"This is very cute sitting on our wood cook stove! It is not real big like some, that is why I like it. Will be great this winter for simmering potpourri, and adding a little moisture to the air. Very pleased with look, size and craftsmanship."
R1N96XFWXXM1QP,Have a kitchen wood stove - have to have this grate in it or the fire won't burn well and the wood won't be consumed.The problem is that it burns right through after a few months.I bought a 2ne one but I know it will burn through in short order.
R1EHK0SS6CMPHA,Used it all winter and never turned on the oil heat in my house. Saved a lot of money with this stove.
R2HWFWFNLOKZUW,"I was looking for real fire brick to solder and weld on. Fire brick is light in color and extremely light, no weight at all. What I received was the right color but each brick weighed over 5 pounds. Cost ME over $30 to ship them back. I hope I get a refund. We`ll see.Disappointed."
RGK999BG0IMXE,"I found this product to be high quality with plenty glue and easy to install.I have found all such products to be expensive but I am satisfied to pay for quality,"
R3P3LDE1J39J2N,"Product is well made and included all hardware. Product clearly meet my expectations. Was unclear whether to purchase the US Stove brand or Vogelzang. Glad, glad I did... Thanks"
R3W0BJ2CAS6ME1,delivered fast and was exactly as stated. Only problem was the pricing. I was in a hurry and need it right away. i guess that is the price I paid quick delivery.
R3QCSGPCVF98Q4,"Without the grate, the US Stove would be difficult to use - both in getting a fire started and keeping the stove in top shape.So, if you are getting a US Stove of this size, this is highly recommended."
R31OOONFB016B8,"I was surprised that a product designed to hold water would immediately rust!I haven't done so yet, but plan to see if I can re-coat the inside with something to protect it and seal out the moisture.Other than that, it looks great!"
R37MJ4EEYYVITL,"I bought this stove kit obviously for a barrel stove.It is very easy to put together.However, I do NOT like the flue on the top.The stove pipe goes into the flue and does not sit very tight due to two reasons.1 and 2.The stove pipe does not go very far into the flue because the pipe hits into the damper.IMHO this is a design flaw.The other companies stove kit connects on the outside and is much sturdier.I was able to simply buy a 6"" extension piece that has a hose clamp on the outside - this piece is used to connect to stove pipe pieces with crimped ends.It fit very snug over the flue and has worked great.I haven't had a problem with this kit not being ""air tight"".You can buy stove door gasket rope or something similar that will make this ""air tight"" but I haven't had a problem.I also did not like the design of the door handle.The handle is fine but the connection is bad.It easily gets loose over time and can fall out or not shut the door tightly - causing a possible fire hazard.I simply added a longer bolt with a lock tight nut.Works good now.Also, when making the barrel stove, be sure to keep the large bung hole on the bottom and use it as a vent for air to get to the bottom of the fire.The slide vent just doesn't work well when you first start the fire - it works fine once the fire gets going.With a little ingenuity you can figure out a way to use the bottom bung hole for air intake.It REALLY gets the fire going that way.I went to a box store and bought 3"" pipe (threads were the same), then a 2"" pipe connector and made a swing door.Cost less than $5.So, with a few minor adjustments this kit works well.I would probably advise getting it at a local box store for a cheaper price when they go on sale.Barrel stove gets HOT and easily heats my 800 sqft garage.I would recommend it for sure for cheap heat."
RH453C6FV4QIP,"This came quickly and works great, we needed to fix my in laws pellet stove and this product did the job at a cheaper price than ordering it from US Stove."
R1KJKAZL7UI88Y,"This was the exact product to replace the blower that came with the stove when I bought it.The original was so noisy we hardly ever used it.This one is ""whisper quiet"" as it says in the description, I wish we would have bought this years ago.UPDATE: Only lasted about 2 years before started getting just as noisy as the original.Changed rating from 5 to 3, and probably won't replace the one that is on there."
R19A4ZJ5DH362K,Dave DionI installed the blower. Its was simple to do.Blower is working fine.It was cheeper to by the blower from Amazon.Cheeper and original parts is always a good thing.
R2DTLW8E3A858A,Decent price--Fast delivery-works like it should--what more can a person be expected to say about a product--that's all I have to say
R1O4SS5M6BTMIN,"this igniter was worth the money, it was easy to install and well worth the cost. I would recommend it to anyone needing one."
R2GTN22CSZDO72,U S stove door gaskets worked out just fine. Did every thing that I expected of it and more lots more.
R3ETH4J6NW0HK6,Very good price for this but would have preferred a 4 and 3 fingered one. Overall though does the job
RMIVM9VC5RG1E,Part was exact match. Overnighted to get stove back up and going. Ordered at 4:30 pm had installed by 3 pm the next day.
R1ADKVJ2DJBI8J,The quality of construction material is excellent. Unfortunately the universal fit comes nowhere close to fitting around the blower motor on my wood furnace. If this was returnable I would gladly buy another more appropriately sized one.
R24SRAQITFPEWM,"I had two tines fall off the original part and lived with it because of the price of a replacement from the company.I found the replacement on Amazon for one quarter the price.The price seemed reasonable, so I bought it.Found it to be well made with good looking welds.It has been in constant use for over 2 months with no problems.It seemed to be a fraction longer than the original and it was hard to install, but I always had problems with the original, putting it back in after a cleaning.Save som good money on this deal!"
R19KYKG1DIKLP9,"I bought two 5500M stoves for two houses. Within 18 months, they both have had the ignitor and PC boards replaced multiple times. Also, when the Pellet bin gets low, smoke from the pellet chamber fills the bin. Eventually the whole house gets filled with smoke. US Stove's support team has been disappointing.I feel ripped-off."
R2TMNU5ZV4HACP,Tractor Supply Company has the same make and model for $899... Please do you research people when buying a pellet stove or anything else... It makes me so upset when I see other venders selling something for 2 and 3 times the price... We as Americans need to stand up for what is right and get what we are due...Gas Station owners get in trouble for price gouging and so should these type of people.
RJNFHHYMLUSXC,"I purchased this after much review of similar products. I was debating the more expensive 80 or 90 dollar options, but many of the reviews of the more expensive models had mixed reviews on there being enough air flow to keep the fire lit. So I figured I'd go with the non-sealed cheaper version and see how it went. Works great for my shop. Gets super hot, quickly! Probably took me half hour or hour to have all assembled. I would say even those who aren't very mechanically enclined could pull this one off, as long as the correct tools are available."
R37I1VKM3O49XH,"Agitator is 10"" Lg. x 2-3/4"" wide made from 1/2"" diameter stainless steel round stock.Fits US Stove 6041TP perfectly.Workmanship could be better and that accounts for the 4 stars instead of 5.Can't beat the price.Paid over 3 times this much on eBay just 2 years ago."
R2C2KC92WSK2VI,I was happy with steamer. It was smaller than I hoped but the base is deeper than it looks.It works good for a insert because is much shallow.
R2OQ6QFGXXL7V7,"Well pleased with purchase ,good fit ,solid brick,and fast shipping from this seller.This replacement was a first for me and it was a breeze with the great fit of brick no need to trim or cut"
R1YHQVH1ZGJXCK,This Blower is an exact replacement for the blower in my 6041 US Stove Pellet Stove.Installs easily and is working perfectly.Amazon has the best price and delivery that I could find for this item.
R250AF3KZNFG0H,It really works well. It moves the heat across the room instead of lingering near the stove. I love it.
RSC1S39299ZQA,"Great kit.Handle could use some re-vamping.I hada time finding a decent barrel to use for it. Where I live, Barrels are hard to get.Just remember ,burn it outside first if your barrel has good paint on it, otherwise it will smoke and stink when you first light it up.I have 4 ft of black pipe attached to it and it works great.If you mount the door like it says in the instructions, the bigger bung plug cap can be used for additional air draw at the bottom of the door.I would advise makinga metalgrate to fit in the bottom to elevate the wood for draw.It will work better."
R3NHB0A1EED7V1,"Within 5 min of getting our grate, it was in use. It fit our Logwood stove PERFECTLY and works perfectly. Our wood stove now operates as it should getting the proper amount of air that it should. I am thrilled with our purchase."
R120E7Q66M00W3,"Of course the item says CHINA right on it so it is not to be unexpected. The cast iron is very thin in places and has multiple pits and splatter marks from the casting process. I suspect it will work just fine, however if i were to go back in time i would probably order the vogelzang damper instead of us stove."
R3SQD2FALF1GDX,"THE DAMPERS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD QUALITY, I WISH I COULD USE. I ORDER THE WRONG PRODUCT.THE PRICE IS UNBEATABLE."
R1MZ1F9NHSXM22,about 1 mo of use and it broke.I should have listened to other reviewers.There's just nothing else out there.It fit... well.... it did!
R2ZVCK6ZAMA7RJ,"when your furnace doesn't work you need to fix it with no messing around, this motor was priced reasonably and arrived quickly fit exactly like it should everything was exactly as advertised and I was able to get the furnace up and running quickly- Thanks"
R3VHVERCBHJ0SJ,We are really enjoying this Chicken Steamer.It arrived in good condition three days after I placed the order. Our stove top is not real large and this steamer looks great on it.
R1ZTJCV54VQCK9,Perfect price and perfect fit. Should get years of more service if it is as good as the original one.
R10H1QNVQ41VXG,Did not fit as advertized.Did not fit properly in the stove it was suppose to fit in. It was said it was to fit my stove model.
R3VC6SOA8D6E5L,I bought this as a christmas present for my mother. It came and was very surprised at the qualityand the overall look of the steamer.
RP5FPMGQDP6C3,"I purchased this in the hopes of releiving some of the dry air that can be associated with a pellet stove, but this steamer is pretty small, and doesn't really help with the dry air. Maybe if it were in a very small room it would work. It is well made and very sturdy."
RQI8MV2HZIMUX,"Don't be tricked into thinking this steamer is like the larger ones, this holds about three cups of water.The metal is fine but not the quality of the more expensive models.It is very nice looking on the wood stove."
R2X104Q4PTGQFR,"After reading the reviews I still ordered the product. Bad decision because within4 hours it had RUSTED!!!!!. The design is really cool and didnt ""look"" pieced together. But I dont want a rusty pot on my stove. Not to mention that they didnt have any more in ""stock"" to sent me a replacement:("
R2UJ3KZU2NIM3R,All of the bricks were broken into at least a couple of pieces.I returned them and did not reorder so I can't comment on how well they work.I wonder how they managed to break five tightly packed bricks into so many pieces?
RKRN26UL5C4CQ,"this is a once a year replacement part...it is a good item, though an d needful for our wood pellet stove..."
R31DU9GMZ6UEY9,"Recvd. the motor in good shipping time.Installed it and it has been working great.If your motor has a fan on it,like mine did,the new motors dont need them.Mine has been installed now for over a month and it has been working perfectly.I would recommend it to anyone and its a lot better priced that the actual stove company - and free shipping.yippy!"
R1TBIWLEC22IC5,"I built and used these in WA state & they do put out nearly twice the heat of the single barrel style. As to the cheesy hardware, the extra functionality with the second barrel is worth another $3-4 bucks for some good hardware. I opted for stainless steel for rain forest application. (Also, doesn't hurt to clean up the casting flashing around the edges, either). In short, ""suck it up & git 'er done!"" The satisfaction of a warm place to work/hang out lasts way longer than the whining over a few screwy nuts & bolts...Update: Sadly, the double barrel kit now runs afoul of the nanny state in WA, so they are no longer available there. Upside: I don't live there anymore..."
R2PPI53924XDP6,"We have used different pellet stoves over the past 5-6 years. This is my first season using this stove. We use the stove in the lower portion of our raised ranch.This past week with the temperature running around 5 degrees Fahrenheit and the stove on setting # 4 it kept the lower portion at 75-78 and up stairs at 70.We are heating 2500 square feet with nothing but this stove.Only negative I can find is the design of the inside of the hopper.The stove can run out of pellets even though there could be 1/4 - 3/8 of the hopper still with pellets.The design does not allow all of the pellets to fall/slide towards the auger.Thus the auger runs out of pellets.I keep an eye on this and just manually move the pellets so this does not happen.Other than that I would highly recommend this stove.At 52,000 btus it does a GREAT job.Also being a Prime member I did not have to pay the shipping charges that Northern Tool wanted to charge."
R15DWDUS7TLIKA,"dimensions were correct and they look just like the old ones I already have in my fireplace.none have cracked or shown any wear, although I haven't really heated up the fireplace very hot...I just use natural gas on low so it really isn't producing much heat."
R1VGQ07LWUJYRG,"Was looking for something for my brother-in-law's wood stove (that didn't cost $69.99 like some other websites), BTW, this was a Christmas gift.Click-click-click-and done.Arrived shortly thereafter by UPS, well packaged so no possibility of damage.At $16.99 it was a great gift, perfect size for the woodstove."
R1M49B7KP8EBY3,"Wow, this is a great little conversion kit for a fifty five gallon drum. We put it in my husbands workshop and it put out so much heat that we had to open the door. This is great for a workshop, garage, barn or house anywhere you need heat."
R38I4VXRRME60W,"I've been looking for a smaller size cast iron humidifier to set on top of our fore place insert for awhile when I saw this one I was ecstatic, it fits perfectly and it's cute."
R3DXJTO9LOQCB5,The product arrived earlier than expected and was as advertised. I am very satisfied with the service I received from this company.
RII1V4VWU7Q6D,These were exactly what we needed to replace the broken fire bricks in our insert.Had tried looking for them elsewhere but hadn't had much luck without spending a fortune.
R1R9Y4PZPBU7NE,"We already own a pellet stove so I have something to compare the King 550M to. Before I bought this I didn't realize how much better my more expensive stove is than the King 550M, we have 2 now. Problems with the King 550M include: CLEANING- This unit is poorly designed so that cleaning it is difficult and can be painful since I have to contort my body so much to reach places. There are small places with immovable parts so my Shop-Vac can't reach easily or can't reach to clean at all. Then I have to reach in with a toothbrush to get the ash to a place that I can vacuum it. There is no temperature regulator either which would be very useful. The troubleshoting guide is only a little helpful with problems. When we needed to repair a part on the King 550M the control panel where the part was located was in the back! You have to use special glue to seal everything so in order to fix the part we had to break the seal, move the extremely heavy stove, then clean and re-seal stove pipes when we were finished. And then move the several-hundred pound stove back again. I paid only $550 for this stove a few years ago. In hindsight, I wish I would have paid more and got another pellet stove that was better quality and easier to care for. When it's clean and working properly it heats very well, that's the good part of it."
R86M7FH8XN7UO,"great price and cust service, pellet stove does my entire house (split level) so that may be why so never the less its sweet!"
R181XQSXLDI5EQ,Used for about a week now. Is not holding up well burning coal.Is the right size just not great cast iron.
R1EYNUHSM6HDCK,"Although there was hardly any packing in the box that the pack was placed in, each brick was whole:)I actually need 8 bricks to complete my fireplace so will be buying more when I get around to it!Arrived quickly."
RTHJOGGUBBZPE,I checked the price of this item at the manufactures website and several other websites. This one here is the same item for a third of the price.
R3RDAXWJ3O6LST,They work for me. I had to cut them down with a hose and a masonry blade on an angle grinder. I put them in a Vermont Castings wood stove.
R1F29JDSXHI4AU,"I've had this stove less then three months, Can't keep the glass clean, it gets black shortly after the fire starts, I've done everything it says too do to keep the glass clean. Now I'm having problems with the ignitor, can't get the stove to start up now."
R1BN61FLCY8MML,"It's firebrick so not much else to say.It arrived quickly, well packaged, and is as advertised.Works great for its intended use.If properly cared for should last a lifetime."
RXBXEXQ9BAO4V,"A little disappointed as I thought it would be a bit larger, especially for the price. As a result I need to fill it a bit more than I'd like to. And after the first use it was very rusty inside. I'm considering spray painting it with some high temp stove paint to prevent all the rust and subsequent rusty residue. Overall it's a pretty cool thing I guess, nothing's perfect, right?"
R2RWB8Q9QDJCYO,My stove has a built in thermostatically controlled fan but I found it doesn't come on until a lot of heat goes up the pipe. With this installed I find the main fan seldom kicks on by the time the room is already up to temp. So this really helps to utilize all the heat that used to just go out the roof.The one down side is on this unit (my second one) the fan is very unbalanced. I mean it vibrates the entire unit.I will be pulling the fan blade and mount it on a piece of metal rod and lightly file the blades until it is balanced.My first reclaimer did not have this issue so it is either luck of the draw or my new one slipped through without being balanced.HTH
R2RYN2XEGVJYBM,"We purchased this item for our Dutchwest wood stove.Most steamers do not work on our stove, as it has a top plate that never gets hot enough to simmer water.The only area on our stove that does get hot enough is about 5-1/2-inches deep, in front of the top plate; this is too small for most steamers, kettles, or pots.This steamer fits perfectly on the small front surface of our stove, and holds 1 quart at its very maximum (as listed in the description).For those with a similar stove, this is a great option!The manufacturing is a little rough, but we're very happy with this purchase (great price too, considering other steamers are $40 to $70).Note:When I first posted this review, this steamer was $16-$17."
R34HUK06AYDXSW,"I don't know if it's the stove or the igniter that is the problem. These things just die. Those cold mornings when I start up the stove and come downstairs 15 minutes later to find the hopper full of pellets that didn't even get warm are just terrible. Worse yet when there's snow on the ground, I have two young children who are shivering, and this is my only means to heat the house.My advice to anyone who relies on this for heat is to keep a backup supply of gelled fire starter on hand. Get a small jar, mix about 1/4th cup of pellets with generous amounts of the fire starter in it, throw that in the hopper, squeeze some more gel in for fun, and start the machine. Light a match and torch the pile. Leave the door slightly ajar until you notice the pellets are good and red in some places. Then close the door and you've got a fire.How many times have I replaced this igniter? This will be my third in two years. Not bad odds compared to everyone else, just a huge hassle. The product is cheaply made. I won't trust a product from this company again."
R2JO0HNIRFA1F4,thes are a good buy the price is great and they fit with no Mod'sI would buy these again
R2UWJG3TRFXOSI,"I am happy with the 5 pin stainless agitator but where do I find the 7 pin stainless agitator for my other stove. This is a really good part. I need a 7 pin, any help thanks"
R8UAUY75FYLD0,"We bought this stove and tried for a month to like it. It sounds like a jet is in the living room and after 6 phone calls to tech support and reprogramming everything, it still blew mild heat. US Stove does not provide a manual that explains all the ways to program, no cd, no nothing. I have read several complaints about their manual so you would think they would hear their customers and make one. exchanged for a different stove."
R3QAT9C2IGDY7K,"Replacementgrates for the BIS 2 (by security chimney) are no longer to be found on their website.I have replaced mine twice in the last 23 years.The purchase price through a warehouse has now risen to >$150.Buy one of these!Then get out your hacksaw. Cut the first bar on each end off.....make the cut even with the second bar on the back side. Also cut the center support even with the second bar.Leave the front full width (creating tabs on the front, that stick out to the left and right) by making the final cut to remove the end bars from the side, just behind the front cross bar.You will find that a little final grinding, or filing, of these two tabs will allow this grate to fit snugly into the ash pan of your BIS.I bought two; one for now and one for 7-8 years in the future when this grate ""burns out.""Be aware that the measurements listed for the G42 on many websites are simply incorrect.I called customer service a US Stove and got a lady with a wonderful Tennessee accent, who very kindly verified the true dimensions of this grate.This is a must if you are trying to use it for an application like mine.Good luck with your project.Updated 9/13/2017I had bought two of these grates and cut them to fit my BIS stove......I just retired the first one due to wear and tear from use....I SEE PEOPLE COMPLAIN OF IRON GRATES ""SAGGING""/""WARPING""/""DEFORMING""!!I believe you will find any maker of grates/stoves/barrel stove kits will WARN YOU! that burning with the draft too fully open will result in such high temperatures that grates will deform and the stove itself can be damaged."
RQ9PGBNNDFGXZ,Used the stove all last year and never had an issue.Heats are 2500sf house very well. Even heat.You can actually hook a thermostat to it which helps save pellets too.I'd highly recommend
R3D0RDUL420176,This product was perfect.and the price was an awesome deal too.The company wanted 65.00 plus s/h for 1 of these. I bought two for 25.00 shipped.wow.Thanks Amizon for all the wonderful deals.
R2D0T2YX6LWBA2,"Good product.Shipped ontime and in good condition.I bought these bricks to replace the ones that had been in a wood burning stove for 30 years.My only problem is I ordered a certain size (Dimensions 4 1/2-Inch by 9-Inch by 1-1/2-Inch) and they shipped 4 1/2-Inch by 9-Inch by 1-1/4-Inch.In all fairness I shimmed up the ones that were sent, with just a little more trouble.Just be aware of the thinner 1-1/4 bricks.Most of the time size is critical."
R33TPSB6EN4IWX,"This is an exact replacement for HotBlast 1557M furnace.I bought it so that I could let one pan cool off while putting the other pan in, because I wanted to be able to use my ash vac to control the ash dust.It works perfectly."
R3RO22CX0XSY3S,"I used these to build a (cork backed) soldering surface, and wow they're perfect! The 2600°F insulation is way more than I need - It's so good that I can have a molten pool of solder on the surface, and not have to worry at all!"
R2JBEJO735DO25,I bought this stove for my ranch in up north Michagain usually I spend one month in the winter for the season change and it gets very cold the furnace kicks a lot and heater bill gets up high by using this stove it helps by providing so much heat and dropped my bill at least $150. I like it so much and I love the fan it distributesa lot of heat every where. I honestly highly recommend it .
RG7AX0YYI4LY0,"The blower was damaged when I received it. Whoever packed it did a bad job. I was able to bend the bracket back so I could use it. I was not happy to see that someone else had the same problem, you would think they would have learned from the other review."
R259Y2XKE17DPL,"US Stove FBP6 Firebrick, Pack of 6 - excellent - fast ship - received unbroken - exact replacement - easy to replace"
R37TAFFUYTRDHK,I bought the US Stove FBP6 firebricks to insulate the inside of my Traeger pellet BBQ/Smoker.My Traeger has trouble regulating heat and getting up to maximum temperature (~450F).The combination of lining the bottom of the BBQ with these firebricks and a new Nomex Gasket on the lid seems to be doing the trick.Granted - it's summer now so I haven't had a chance to test it below 65F but it is regulating much better and reaching higher temperatures than a couple of weeks ago.Now I can grill pizza in a reasonable amount of time with a better crust.--------------------------------Update: 10/10/12 I had a chance to use my Traeger in temperatures hovering around 50F and the bricks worked beautifully.Managed to keep it above 400F which works great for pizza and kept a more consistent heat at lower temperatures for all my other cooking.
R8TKU3KVW3RKL,"If you get a working one, you are in good shape.If you get a lemon, US Stove does not stand behind its product.My stove started up with so much flame that the window was blackened in minutes and the flame out of control.I called repeatedly and wrote online.It took 2 weeks to get a response.Then the ignitor went out after 3 months.They have so far refused to pay the repair fellow in whole and I am stuck with the bill after multiple emails of pleading.But yes, they sent the ignitor for free to their credit.When it shuts down, the pellets continue to drop so the flame continues as well; trouble is, eventually not enough heat is generated to trigger the fan, so my home fills with smoke.Some adjustments were made and it works MOST of the time without smoking out the house.Most of the time isn't good enough if you don't want your home smoke damaged.I finally got through on their help line about adjusting the controls and now the stove is completely dangerous filling the pellet catch to the brim with an exploding flame (think they either went the wrong direction or the stove is not programmed right).I have many emails to their write-in center, but receive no answer back.When I ask about the warranty, they only say, ""Try to work with it""--there is no warranty.You cannot send their lemon stove back.If you save for months like me to buy a quality product and end up with this one, you will have no recourse."
R1Z718WTMFD8WT,"This is a nice quiet source to recover lost heat (thru the chimney.It moves a plenty of warm air to heat up a room faster.I bought a secondunit to put into one of the rentals I have to help spread the heat more.Pros:Lightweight and easy to repair/maintain. Good airflow thru the exchanger for heat recovery.Inxpensive to purchase.Cons:Must clean more frenquently then a normal Chimney pipe.Becuase of the air moving over the cooling tubes, creaosote tendsto condensate and build up at this point much quicker which will cause smoke to back up into the stove.Like keepingyour damper openand opening the door.I clean mine every 3 months while using it.I have been using mine for 3 winters now.If the fire is allowed to get to hot and the chimney starts to turn red, it will damage the thermostat.This is an easyrepair, Loosen and remove 2 screws and pull out and replace thermostat.The thermostat is about $15 plus shipping(not available thru amazon)"
RS8UO930P396W,"Purchased in January of this year, already needs replaced, the dealer's price is actually lower at this time,did not thinkk about checking for a warranty when i ordered in January"
R38PQ781P3SVY9,Ive had this unit in my house for several months. For the first two weeks the fan squealed and was very obnoxious. We were ready to return it when the sound stopped and it hasn't done it since. From time to time the front grate rattles. Its a bit loud when your sitting in a quiet room enjoying the fire an the unit clicks on. But when its running for a time its not too bad. If the fire is low around 200f it tends to click on and off frequently. The image here shows silver trim. The image on the packaging shows silver trim. We have silver trim on our stove. But the unit has gold trim. Ive decided to keep it as the price is good and it works for our needs.
R33QAVNQGX4YSS,"I paid $50.00 for this, I noticed that after casting the manufacture didn't clean the edges very well there was some excess metal casting around some edges, however that didn't take away from the design or over all quality, besides it was ""inexpensive"" not cheap. Bottom line works great I had to leave the larger hole in the barrel off for an air vent, but once I did that, worked like a charm. I love it so far, I have had it about 3 months used it 4 times, so far so good."
R16DFA04UL9B93,I have been using this unit in my shop all winter now. It does a good job saving a good part of the heat from just being lost up the chimney. The fan is a bit loud sometimes its a squealing noise sometimes it's a rattle. Also had to remove temp. sensor since it will not work on a GFCI protected outlet.
R11SA4LF5XQL3A,"I feel obligated to post this warning about a serious fire hazard I found on my new King 5500M pellet stove. For a little background I have been battling this stoves burn since I got it in Oct 2011. After several calls they sent me replacement gaskets which I installed and through a forum I found what is likely to be the real problem the feed rate... If you have a problem with the burn pot filling up manually adjust the feed rate(something never mentioned by the manufacturer after a dozen calls).So I change the gaskets and adjust the feed rate last night and the stove runs pretty good, shut it down today and I notice smoke coming out of the bottom of the stove so I look and find piles of ash on both of the front corners of the stove, the side that has smoke pouring out also has a few half burnt pellets... thinking wtf did the stove crack? I vacuum the stove out for a better look to find 2 perfectly drilled holes right through the bottom of the stove. Call the company again to hear ""Oh there are suppose to be bolts there"" then WHY aren't they there???? Mind you I have been running this stove for 6 months and had no idea this stove could have burnt my house down! Not to mention all the trouble I have been going through to get it more ""air-tight"". Check your stove it could be a fire hazard."
R1E0FX3V8CFVHQ,does exactly what you bought it for.shipping and price was excellent!i used it to create a forge for heat treating 4130 steel. I also bought the DAP high heat mortar from Amazon to create my boxy forge.everything worked like a miracle =) thanks again to amazon for making it easy to find this stuff.
R3UYZ1QL7VIYCE,"In less than a year the ignitor stopped working.The Ignitor was covered under the 1 year warranty period.I contacted the seller of the stove (a 5500M King/Ashley Pellet Stove from TSC-Tractor Supply Company) in Oroville, California for the name of anyone doing repairs.The ""manager"" could not or would not provide any assistance and I felt I had truly bothered him by requesting help on this issue.Not a repair person's name or any courtesy for a customer with a problem with one of their sales.I called United States Stove Company regarding the King/Ashley Pellet Stove problem.They were very courteous and because the stove was less than 1 year old, they would send an ignitor under the warranty.Due to the cold shoulder from TSR, I decided to replace the ignitor myself, which was not a difficult process.The stove was purchased at the end of 2010, and within a month of starting the 2011 fall, the ignitor failed.Replaced the new ignitor, and it has operated for the past 4-5 months and is out again, which is approximately the same number of months for the original ignitor from the factory.Is this a faulty ignitor system? At $45.+ each, this is a potentially an extra stove cost of +/-$9.00 per operational month. I have another pellet stove which is not an ignitor type, but it is 9 years old and we have not had any problems."
R2GOX6PIO1JNHH,"This same product sells for $20 everywhere else, and is in no way different from those $20 versions, but I feel this was money well spent. Whatever the reason for a 37 times increase in price, I'm happy i did."
R1L2M4UXL48GWS,"We have a US Stove King model and recently noticed a few broken firebricks. Breakage was likely due to use of overly large, heavy logs that came with a load of purchased firewood. We cut and split our own now; oversized logs won't be an issue in the future.Neither will short firewood loads but that's a story for another day.These bricks are standard, identical in size to the OEM firebricks that most wood and coal burning stoves come with. Very easy to install and the packaging was done right with air pillows. Arrived intact two days after placing the order."
R3U7K7IJDK26M1,"We bought the filter box to go with our Hotblast Furnace.We received it very quickly and it arrived in perfect condition.It does help muffle the noise of the furnace motor for the blowers.The filter is so easy to change, just lift one out and put the other in.Works well.It does not come assembled (which my husband washappy about)but goes together easily."
R2AHM1BF9TT9X4,Product was recieved in 3 days and the exact fit. Hole is drilled in the shaft for roll pin unlike after market where shaft is solid. This is the real deal quicker and cheaper than i could get from US Stoves manufactor.
R31VQ8IEZBMJRQ,Can as described.Fits our wood stove perfectly.Shipped on time.Wouldn't know what we would do with out US Stove.Having this great product
R2NQSB9NNM7M4N,"Good stove, As loud as an air conditioner. Be sure to use low ash pellets or stove burnppot will fill and not burn properly."
R345MFWG12KSMO,"Do not buy this stove!I purchasd mine at TSC, same stove!It burns so dirty I have to clean the burn pot every 8 hours.The glass is pitch black in 8 hours.I am in contact with the factory.The factory is having me attempting to adjust the fuel rate.Why wasn't is correct from the factory.On start up the burn pot is over filled with pellets which causes the rate of burn to start out to rich and stay that way.The factory suggested opening the lid to the pellet hopper once enough pellets were in the stove to cover the igniter.Why don't they adjust the fill rate from the factory.Now I have to stand by the stove watch the pellets fall in the burn pot and then open the hopper lid, then wait for the timers to time out and the fire to burn the excess pellets.Close the lid and wait for the fire to burn really dirty.If I clean the burn pot every 6 hours or so the stove works ok.Go spend the extra money and buy a well made pellet stove!1/6/2012"

R39RELBA85EDFP,"The hardware for this abomination looks like it was scooped out of a scrap bin. Most of the bolts did not have threads cut in them, washers were incomplete and 3 nuts had a broken tap in them. The hardware was loose in the box. I hope the Chinese don't build airplanes. Amazon, as usual, gave an immediate refund and paid for the return freight. This is one of the reasons that I give Amazon so much of my business. They are very customer oriented."
R3852OH27IPRGJ,This turner is identical to the one that I purchased through the stove company but about 1/3 the price.Seems to work just as well as the original.
R2S3M39URI3ULE,Northern Tool has been wonderful:-)This stove heats our entire house.We only put it on the highest level to see what it would do and it felt like summer in here.Our house house is over 1900 sq feet.We leave it on the lowest setting overnight.It took about 2 hours to install.We are extremely happy with Northern Tool and their customer service as well as this US Stove product:-)I would definitely recommend this multi-fuel stove to anyone.We have friends come to visit and they too are considering getting one.I hope they do:-)
R1EIHS2XXOKGSV,Done my research before purchasing.Wanted to be sure it was the correct item.The price was very good. Shipping was fast and the grate is installed and working great.Five stars to the retailer and Amazon.
R3B1L31Z1TRLOZ,"I own two King wood stoves and the baffles on both had holes burned in the middle. One stove is about 8 years old and the other is 4 years old. I ordered and received one in quick order, placed it in the stove and it is doing its job perfectly. After installing the first one, I ordered, received, and installed the second one which is also working just fine. Two great transactions."

R2JKX3961PD7EF,"We have had ours for 3 winters. After the 2nd season one of the blowers started to squeal. Loudly! Called the company. They sent us a piece of felt and told me to apply it to the area where the heat comes out. I said to my self ""really."" So I looked high and low for a new blower and never found one. As this ended up being the source of noise. Ended up having a friend lube it up and check it out. It would only make noise if we turned the heat up past 4. Then during season 3 the other blower started making noise too. But only upon start up. After about 10 minutes it will stop.Using corn in it causes a lot of ashes. But burns a lot hotter. Makes a lot of clunkers though.Cleaning is not bad. Dont use a house vacuum as I had an arc come off the pin on the auger and it blew the fuse in my vacuum cleaner. The stove was off but still plugged in. So make sure the stove in unplugged when vacuuming. They give no directions to cleaning. I didnt know about the large amount of ash that goes behind the two pieces of metal that are like doors. I take those off and use a tooth brush to get in the hole to push it over where the vacuum can get it. The first year we used it I didnt know that those doors came off. When we started to use it the next season it kept smelling like smoke. I started exploring and found this area FULL of ash. Cleaned it out and the problem was solved.The glass gets black after about 2 uses. So we are always wiping that off.Its kinda loud I think but have never heard any other stoves to compare this one too.The heat is wonderful and the electric board has held up. The blowers need to be built to last longer and quieter."

RRBZMW5MZX0RM,"Have not had a chance to use it yet. It was very easy to install in the stove portion of the flue 1970's plate steel woodsman wood stove. Capable of heating 3000 sq ft I'm installing a 1600 sq ft.ranch style home.The fit is perfect and the damper rotates nicely in the pipe as it should. I'll let you know when I have a chance to use it looks like next winter my only concern is warpage as so many do especially ones made in china, sorry china not real happy with the quality of goods that come from that country"
R8LNS8NBTFO5G,"Got our stove installed yesterday and we are very pleased with it.Still experimenting with the settings, but find it heats our open large area well.The stove looks nice in our log style home, and we hope that it will greatly lower our oil bills. We have it on the #2 fan setting and it is a quiet soothing sound.On the lower setting it is very quiet.Price was right and delivery prompt.No complaints at this time."
R4K14I8Y776AF,"This item was not made quite as well as I expected, but it doesn't look bad, and it is functional for my intended purpose (filled with water and placed on top of our fireplace heater, it keeps our home's air from drying out too much)."
R3K54JX50VZU3E,This isn't nearly as nice as I thought it would be. It looks great in the photo. It's pieced together awkwardly in a visually unappealing way. It's smaller than you think it's going to be. It's really not worth the price -- even without the ridiculous shipping fee.
RH7D7OAUOF409,"I bought this for a friend who loves old-fashioned home accessories and also roosters.It couldn't have been a better choice, and she gets lots of use from it in the winter.This low-tech humidifier looks great on the woodstove, and there is no worry about it breaking down.I'm sure it will outlast us all.Use it for potpourri or just add clear water for humidity.Two. Two. Two products in one!"

WSICBWVTBU,This is the worse thing ive ever purchased. I cant even get one stick of wood in this piece of crap. It looked much bigger in the picture
H4ASVFLBAY,Great little camp stove.  It keeps our camp in Northern Maine toasty warm.  It’s a perfect fit.  It burns very efficiently.
EFN0ECHFTH,"Too small for the money,"
8TAYQUS3LL,Delivery dropped the package and broke the stove.  Had to chose a different stove.
7OOG2BYUMF,"I have a 1960's version of this stove design, all the parts are even interchangeable, same casting design. There problems people have are when the damper and flu aren't balanced. Mine burns well, no smoke inside once set right. I can load it up and it'll heat most of the night without attention. There's a reason this stove design has been around a very long time, it's proven, and works great."
DCLCJAZRLM,"Love the wood stove, unfortunately none of the parts come with it, pipe, pipe connections, pipe Jack's, brick, furnace cement etc and none of the Home Depot employees had any idea on these items so I am still trying to get the right parts ordered after getting wrong sizes."
9UBPZKMBY1,"The stove arrived very well packaged! It was simple to assemble and looks really nice! 
The first fire kept going out due to poor airflow, but that may be caused by the chimney not being warm yet. I will need to have more fires to determine the cause. It looks beautiful in place of the old rusted boxwood stove. Very happy, providing I can solve the issue causing it to stop burning."

G6XJGUKZV3,The stove is as advertised..not alot of bells and whistles..home depot was amazing on the customer service and thanks
C7GC1BBJUB,Received earlier than expected so that was great !
SPLX8RQQVX,Extremely easy to install. I've already recommended it to a lot of friends. Great for outside brush piles.
NEAU6PKLUN,"Not only does it fit a barrel, but I’ve put my kit on to an oil tank that I cut out and had a friend weld. The only draw back is the damper doesn’t let in enough air to get a big fire going needed to get a big boil on the sap. Another thing I’ve noticed is the door is showing some rust, possibly due to the heat from the wood fire.  However, it works well and looks awesome. I would purchase this product again."
F2EKQEXBF2,"super hot stove safe for a garage or a barn, gets up to temp fast."
TQEZ6YLKZV,This kit was really easy to install. I used a small barrel and the kit still fit. Looks great in my pallet greenhouse. I love it!
AHHNHHWYFT,Im very happy with the stove kit works real well and it don't smoke. I use it to build a maple syrup evaporater to make syrup
Z8BTXE8OHH,"First of all, this is made in China. And its not very good cast iron. Tots of voids and such - clearly the result of poor sand and worn patterns. 

It arrived quickly, but one of the legs that goes between the barrels was broken. Called US stove (per included directions) and was assured a replacement would be sent out immediately. Received it almost 14 days later. And it was the wrong part. Not that it mattered anyway: the between barrel leg kit is too big to match the coupler that is shipped with the kit.

Speaking of too big, the legs really don't fit the curvature of a 55 gallon drum.

Additionally, its pretty obvious that the legs were originally designed to have two bars holding them together, not just a tiny 1/4 inch machine screw and nut. A fender washer is a must for safety. And, be prepared to use a grinder on the legs to get a good finish - lots of flash and such left in place.

Lastly, carefully reading the manufacturers instructions, the stove is not recommended or intended for actual use. Just temporary outdoor use only. Not intended for heating. I guess its for looks only.

Its pretty darn clear to me that this was seriously re-engineered to be a cheap knockoff product of what was originally back in the day an excellent product that was a testament to backyard engineering and DIY craftsmanship.

As you can see from the picture, I did some serious mods to make this effective."
YU5DAP2KFW,It was awesome and easy to install looks wonderful thank you .
ZISLMWMKU0,"Winter is fast approaching. This is a four year testament review to a barrel kit heater. I purchased everything I needed to put a barrel heater in my shop four years ago and could not be any happier. On the coldest days this system will run you out of my shop. As one can see, I sat the heater on blocks for better air flow, used black stove pipe, and a heater barrel sold here at The Home Depot. I learned that the key to a long lasting system is to apply high heat paint on my stove components and change the pipe and barrel out if pin holes appear. I highly recommend adding 5- 6 inches of dirt (yes dirt) or sand-spread out evenly to the bottom and getting a grate for the wood to sit on. This keeps the heater bottom from burning out prematurely. An old trick used by many wood heating people. The heat is regulated by the damper and the air flow door on the kit. I do not recommend this type of system for indoor applications. The Home Depot sells many quality stoves and triple wall pipe systems for safe in- home use. I highly recommend this simple kit and type of heater solution for those on a budget. Now is the time to get ready for the colder days ahead!"

HQUBZBHBPI,Overall it met our expectations and came in cheaper than most on the internet but it was missing a bit of hardware (4 nuts and the handle).
DTMKDYY1HI,Good product but doesn't come with pipe to connect add on barrel
CALNCCZQ1K,"It's a well made kit, and easy to understand.   It says 30 gallon to 56 gallon barrels, but if you don't use the largest size barrel, the castings won't fit well to the metal barrel, and you will have to buy heatproof mortar and use it to caulk the openings."
